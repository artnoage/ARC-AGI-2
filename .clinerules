# Cline Rules - Project Intelligence

This file captures key patterns, preferences, and insights discovered during the project lifecycle. It helps Cline (the AI assistant) work more effectively and consistently within this specific project context.

## Core Principles & Preferences

*   [Document overarching principles or user preferences for development, e.g., "Prefer functional components in React," "Always include unit tests for new backend logic."]

## Important Implementation Patterns

*   [Describe recurring code structures or architectural patterns specific to this project, e.g., "State management follows the Redux pattern with specific middleware," "API error handling uses a centralized middleware."]

## Tooling & Workflow Notes

*   **Benchmark Testing:** Always use the `GEMINI_FLASH` model identifier when running benchmark tests, unless explicitly requested otherwise. (e.g., `python benchmark/run_benchmark.py --model_identifier GEMINI_FLASH ...`)
*   [Record project-specific tool usage or workflow steps, e.g., "Use `npm run lint:fix` before committing," "Deployment requires manual approval step X."]

## Known Challenges & Workarounds

*   [Note any persistent technical challenges or established workarounds, e.g., "Legacy module X has performance issues under load; use caching strategy Y," "Browser compatibility issue with Z requires specific CSS hack."]

## Decision Log

*   [Optionally, track significant decisions and their rationale if not covered elsewhere.]
