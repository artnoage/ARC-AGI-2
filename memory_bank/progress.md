# Progress

## What works

*   Created the `benchmark` directory.
*   Created the `benchmark/simple_agent.py` file with the basic agent structure and system prompt.
*   Initialized memory bank documentation files.
*   Created the core benchmark structure files:
    *   `benchmark/config.py`: Handles configuration, including model selection (`ModelOption`) and parameters.
    *   `benchmark/data_loader.py`: Handles loading individual ARC task files.
    *   `benchmark/model_utils.py`: Provides model instantiation (`get_model`) and API interaction logic (local/OpenRouter) with retries.
    *   `benchmark/simple_agent.py`: Asynchronous agent logic (`get_reasoning`) using `model_utils`.
    *   `benchmark/run_benchmark.py`: Asynchronous orchestration script integrating config, data loading, model initialization, agent processing, and result saving.

## What's left to build

*   Testing the full benchmark execution with a configured and running model (local server or OpenRouter API key).
*   Potential refinement of results format or logging.
*   Optional: Add command-line argument parsing for configuration.
*   Optional: Add more advanced features (statistics, progress tracking) if needed later.

## Current status

The benchmark structure is complete and integrates the model calling logic adapted from the `old_project`. It is ready for testing with a live model endpoint.

## Known issues

*   The data loading strategy uses individual files from the configured directory, avoiding issues with the large `data/dataset.json`.
*   Requires testing with a live model endpoint (local server or OpenRouter API key).
