# Progress

## What works

**Phase 1: Synthetic Data Generation Interface (Completed)**
*   Web-based testing interface (`apps/testing_interface.html`) for ARC tasks.
*   Functionality for task transformations (reflection, rotation, etc.).
*   Functionality for adding/managing reasoning traces.
*   Distance metric UI feedback.
*   Data structure definition (`data/nature_of_data.md`).

**Phase 2: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning (Implemented, Needs Testing)**
*   `benchmark/` directory structure established.
*   Core components implemented:
    *   `config.py`: Handles configuration (models, parameters, paths).
    *   `data_loader.py`: Loads individual ARC task files.
    *   `model_utils.py`: Manages model instantiation and API interactions (local/OpenRouter) with retries.
    *   `simple_agent.py`: Contains the agent logic for prompting the model.
    *   `run_benchmark.py`: Orchestrates the benchmark execution (async), now with command-line argument parsing (`argparse`) and enhanced logging.
*   Benchmark refinement:
    *   Enhanced logging (DEBUG level, file output) added across benchmark scripts.
    *   JSON output format improved (metadata, full prompts, model username).
*   Auxiliary utility created:
    *   `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py`: Merges benchmark reasoning into `data/traces_store.json`, storing reasoning in the `text` field and creating new entries for each merged reasoning trace for an existing task ID.
*   Memory Bank and `readme.md` updated to reflect both phases and recent changes.

## What's left to build (Phase 2)

*   Manually execute the benchmark (`python benchmark/run_benchmark.py --model_identifier <MODEL> --max_tasks <N>`) with live model endpoints.
*   Analyze detailed logs (`benchmark_debug.log`) for any issues.
*   Use the `merge_reasoning.py` script to integrate results into `data/traces_store.json`.
*   Analyze the merged reasoning data.
*   Potentially add more advanced analysis or reporting features later.

## Current status

*   **Phase 1 is complete.** The synthetic data generation interface is functional.
*   **Phase 2 is implemented and refined.** The benchmarking suite structure is complete, integrates model interaction logic, and includes improved configuration, logging, and output formatting. It is ready for manual execution and testing against actual models. The auxiliary reasoning merge script is also complete.

## Known issues (Phase 2)

*   Requires manual execution and testing with live model endpoints (`.env` needs valid API keys or local server running).
*   Performance and quality of reasoning output depend heavily on the chosen model and prompting strategy.
*   Potential for errors during API calls (network issues, invalid keys, rate limits) - check `benchmark_debug.log` for details.
