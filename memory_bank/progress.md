# Progress

## What works

**Phase 1: Synthetic Data Generation Interface (Completed)**
*   Web-based testing interface (`apps/testing_interface.html`) for ARC tasks.
*   Functionality for task transformations (reflection, rotation, etc.).
*   Functionality for adding/managing reasoning traces.
*   Distance metric UI feedback.
*   Data structure definition (`data/nature_of_data.md`).

**Phase 2: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning (Implemented, Needs Testing)**
*   `benchmark/` directory structure established.
*   Core components implemented:
    *   `config.py`: Handles configuration (models, parameters, paths).
    *   `data_loader.py`: Loads individual ARC task files.
    *   `model_utils.py`: Manages model instantiation and API interactions (local/OpenRouter) with retries.
    *   `simple_agent.py`: Contains the agent logic for prompting the model.
    *   `run_benchmark.py`: Orchestrates the benchmark execution (async).
*   Memory Bank and `readme.md` updated to reflect both phases.

## What's left to build (Phase 2)

*   Execute and thoroughly test the benchmark (`python benchmark/run_benchmark.py`) with live model endpoints (local server / OpenRouter API key).
*   Analyze generated reasoning outputs (`data/evaluation/`).
*   Refine results format, logging, or agent prompting based on testing.
*   Consider adding command-line arguments for configuration flexibility.
*   Potentially add more advanced analysis or reporting features later.

## Current status

*   **Phase 1 is complete.** The synthetic data generation interface is functional.
*   **Phase 2 is implemented.** The benchmarking suite structure is complete and integrates model interaction logic. It is ready for execution and testing against actual models.

## Known issues (Phase 2)

*   Requires configuration (`benchmark/config.py`, `.env`) and testing with live model endpoints.
*   Performance and quality of reasoning output depend heavily on the chosen model and prompting strategy.
