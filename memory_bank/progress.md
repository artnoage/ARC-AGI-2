# Progress

## What works

**Phase 1: Synthetic Data Generation Interface (Completed)**
*   Web-based testing interface (`apps/testing_interface.html`) for ARC tasks.
*   Functionality for task transformations (reflection, rotation, etc.).
*   Functionality for adding/managing reasoning traces.
*   Distance metric UI feedback.
*   Data structure definition (`data/nature_of_data.md`).

**Phase 2: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning (Implemented, Needs Testing)**
*   `benchmark/` directory structure established.
*   Core components implemented:
    *   `config.py`: Handles configuration (models, parameters, paths), now includes `use_dataset_json` flag.
    *   `data_loader.py`: Loads individual ARC task files and now also includes `load_tasks_from_dataset` for loading from `dataset.json`.
    *   `model_utils.py`: Manages model instantiation and API interactions (local/OpenRouter) with retries.
    *   `simple_agent.py`: Contains the agent logic for prompting the model for reasoning only.
    *   `code_generating_agent.py`: Contains agent logic for prompting the model for both reasoning and Python code.
    *   `generate_reasoning_traces.py` (formerly `run_benchmark.py`): Orchestrates the reasoning trace generation execution using `SimpleAgent` (async), with features like CLI args, concurrency control, periodic saving, and graceful exit.
    *   `run_code_generation_benchmark.py`: Orchestrates the code generation benchmark execution using `CodeGeneratingAgent` (async), mirroring the features of the reasoning trace script but saving both reasoning and code.
*   Benchmark refinement (applied to both scripts where applicable):
    *   Enhanced logging (DEBUG level, file output to `benchmark_debug.log`).
    *   Added `max_concurrent_tasks` to `config.py` and CLI arguments.
    *   JSON output format improved (metadata, full prompts, model username).
    *   Implemented periodic saving (every `SAVE_INTERVAL` tasks) to **append** new results to fixed files (`benchmark_partial_results.jsonl` or `code_gen_benchmark_partial_results.jsonl`) in **JSON Lines format**.
    *   Implemented final saving on normal exit (`atexit`) or interruption (`SIGINT`) to timestamped `.json` files (with distinct prefixes and `_interrupted` suffix if needed), containing the full accumulated results.
*   Auxiliary utility created and used:
    *   `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py`: Merges reasoning benchmark results into `data/traces_store.json`. Successfully used for the `GEMINI_FLASH` run.
*   Memory Bank and `readme.md` updated to reflect both phases and recent changes.
*   **Reasoning Trace Generation Execution:** Successfully ran `generate_reasoning_traces.py` (`python benchmark/generate_reasoning_traces.py --model_identifier GEMINI_FLASH --max_tasks 15 --max_concurrent_tasks 3`).
    *   Verified periodic saving to `benchmark_partial_results.jsonl`.
    *   Verified final results saved to `benchmark/benchmark_results/benchmark_results_20250504_163628.json`.
    *   Checked logs (`benchmark_debug.log`) for correct execution.
*   **Code Generation Benchmark Creation & Execution:**
    *   Created `benchmark/code_generating_agent.py` with logic to request reasoning and Python code.
    *   Created `benchmark/run_code_generation_benchmark.py` based on the reasoning trace script, adapting it to use `CodeGeneratingAgent` and save both reasoning and Python code.
    *   Successfully ran the script: `python benchmark/run_code_generation_benchmark.py --model_identifier GEMINI_FLASH --max_tasks 10 --max_concurrent_tasks 3`.
    *   Verified periodic saving to `code_gen_benchmark_partial_results.jsonl`.
    *   Verified final results saved to `benchmark/benchmark_results/code_gen_benchmark_results_20250504_165606.json`.
    *   Checked logs (`code_gen_benchmark_debug.log`) for correct execution.
*   **Code Verification Script:**
    *   Created `benchmark/verify_generated_code.py` to execute generated Python code against ARC task test cases.
    *   Refined the script to use `task_data` embedded directly within the benchmark results file, removing the need to load a separate `dataset.json`.
*   **Agent Structure Refactoring:**
    *   Created `agents/` directory.
    *   Moved `benchmark/simple_agent.py` to `agents/reasoning_trace_generator.py`.
    *   Moved `benchmark/code_generating_agent.py` to `agents/reasoning_code_generator.py`.
    *   Updated import paths in `benchmark/generate_reasoning_traces.py` and `benchmark/run_code_generation_benchmark.py`.
    *   Updated `memory_bank/systemPatterns.md` and `memory_bank/activeContext.md` to reflect the new structure.

## What's left to build (Phase 2)

*   **Run Code Verification:** Execute the `benchmark/verify_generated_code.py` script on the code generation results (`code_gen_benchmark_results_20250504_165606.json`) to assess correctness. (Next immediate step).
*   **Analyze Verification Results:** Review the output and logs (`code_verification_debug.log`) from the verification script.
*   **Analyze Reasoning Data:** Evaluate the quality of the `GEMINI_FLASH` reasoning from the reasoning benchmark run (merged into `data/traces_store.json`).
*   **Analyze Code Generation Results (Qualitative):** After verification, perform a qualitative review of the reasoning and code in `code_gen_benchmark_results_20250504_165606.json`, especially for failed tasks.
*   **Refine Agents/Prompts:** Based on verification results and qualitative analysis, potentially refine `simple_agent.py` and/or `code_generating_agent.py`.
*   Consider further benchmark runs (reasoning or code generation) with different models or parameters.
*   Potentially create utilities to merge/analyze the code generation benchmark results (beyond simple execution/verification).

## Current status

*   **Phase 1 is complete.** The synthetic data generation interface is functional.
*   **Phase 2 implementation ongoing.**
    *   The reasoning trace generation benchmark (`generate_reasoning_traces.py`) has been implemented, tested, and executed successfully with `GEMINI_FLASH`. Results merged into `data/traces_store.json`.
    *   The code generation benchmark (`run_code_generation_benchmark.py`) has been implemented and executed successfully with `GEMINI_FLASH`. Results saved to `benchmark/benchmark_results/code_gen_benchmark_results_20250504_165606.json`.
    *   The code verification script (`benchmark/verify_generated_code.py`) has been implemented and refined to use embedded task data.
    *   Next step is to run the code verification script.

## Known issues (Phase 2)

*   Requires manual execution and testing with live model endpoints (`.env` needs valid API keys or local server running).
*   Performance and quality of output depend heavily on the chosen model and prompting strategy.
*   Potential for errors during API calls (network issues, invalid keys, rate limits) - check `benchmark_debug.log` for details.
*   Optimal `max_concurrent_tasks` value may depend on the model API's rate limits, local system resources, and network latency.
*   Saving results requires write permissions to the `benchmark/benchmark_results/` directory.
