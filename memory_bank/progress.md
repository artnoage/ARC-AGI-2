# Progress

## What works

**Phase 1: Synthetic Data Generation Interface (Completed)**
*   Web-based testing interface (`apps/testing_interface.html`) for ARC tasks.
*   Functionality for task transformations (reflection, rotation, etc.).
*   Functionality for adding/managing reasoning traces.
*   Distance metric UI feedback.
*   Data structure definition (`data/nature_of_data.md`).

**Phase 2: Synthetic Data Generation & Verification (Implemented, Needs Testing)**
*   `synthetic_data_generators/` directory structure established.
*   Core components implemented:
    *   `utilities/config.py`: Handles configuration (models, parameters, paths), now includes `use_dataset_json` flag.
    *   `utilities/data_loader.py`: Loads individual ARC task files and now also includes `load_tasks_from_dataset` for loading from `dataset.json`.
    *   `utilities/model_utils.py`: Manages model instantiation and API interactions (local/OpenRouter) with retries.
    *   `agents/reasoning_trace_generator.py`: Contains the agent logic for prompting the model for reasoning only.
    *   `agents/reasoning_code_generator.py`: Contains agent logic for prompting the model for both reasoning and Python code.
    *   `synthetic_data_generators/generate_reasoning_data.py`: Orchestrates the reasoning data generation using `ReasoningTraceGenerator` (async), with features like CLI args, concurrency control, periodic saving, and graceful exit.
    *   `synthetic_data_generators/generate_code_data.py`: Orchestrates the code data generation using `ReasoningCodeGenerator` (async), mirroring the features of the reasoning data script but saving both reasoning and code.
*   Data Generation refinement (applied to both scripts where applicable):
    *   Enhanced logging (DEBUG level, file output to `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data_generation.log` and `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data_generation.log`).
    *   Added `max_concurrent_tasks` to `utilities/config.py` and CLI arguments.
    *   JSON output format improved (metadata, full prompts, model username).
    *   Implemented periodic saving (every `SAVE_INTERVAL` tasks) to **append** new results to fixed files (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data/reasoning_data_partial_results.jsonl` or `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_partial_results.jsonl`) in **JSON Lines format**.
    *   Implemented final saving on normal exit (`atexit`) or interruption (`SIGINT`) to timestamped `.json` files (with distinct prefixes/paths like `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data/reasoning_data_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` and `_interrupted` suffix if needed), containing the full accumulated results.
*   Auxiliary utility created and used:
    *   `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py`: Merges reasoning data results into `data/traces_store.json`. Successfully used for the `GEMINI_FLASH` run.
*   Memory Bank and `readme.md` updated to reflect both phases and recent changes.
*   **Reasoning Data Generation Execution:** Successfully ran `generate_reasoning_data.py` (`python synthetic_data_generators/generate_reasoning_data.py --model_identifier GEMINI_FLASH --max_tasks 15 --max_concurrent_tasks 3`).
    *   Verified periodic saving to `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data/reasoning_data_partial_results.jsonl`.
    *   Verified final results saved to `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data/reasoning_data_results_20250504_163628.json`.
    *   Checked logs (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data_generation.log`) for correct execution.
*   **Code Data Generation Creation & Execution:**
    *   Created `agents/reasoning_code_generator.py` with logic to request reasoning and Python code.
    *   Created `synthetic_data_generators/generate_code_data.py` based on the reasoning data script, adapting it to use `ReasoningCodeGenerator` and save both reasoning and Python code.
    *   Successfully ran the script: `python synthetic_data_generators/generate_code_data.py --model_identifier GEMINI_FLASH --max_tasks 10 --max_concurrent_tasks 3`.
    *   Verified periodic saving to `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_partial_results.jsonl`.
    *   Verified final results saved to `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`.
    *   Checked logs (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data_generation.log`) for correct execution.
*   **Code Verification Script:**
    *   Created `synthetic_data_generators/verify_generated_code.py` to execute generated Python code against ARC task test cases.
    *   Refined the script to use `task_data` embedded directly within the data generation results file, removing the need to load a separate `dataset.json`.
*   **Agent Structure Refactoring:**
    *   Created `agents/` directory.
    *   Moved `benchmark/simple_agent.py` to `agents/reasoning_trace_generator.py`. (Note: This move was part of a previous refactor, kept for historical context if needed).
    *   Moved `benchmark/code_generating_agent.py` to `agents/reasoning_code_generator.py`. (Note: This move was part of a previous refactor, kept for historical context if needed).
    *   Updated import paths in `synthetic_data_generators/generate_reasoning_data.py` and `synthetic_data_generators/generate_code_data.py`.
    *   Updated `memory_bank/systemPatterns.md` and `memory_bank/activeContext.md` to reflect the new structure.

**Phase 3: Real Benchmarking (Implemented, Needs Testing)**
*   A new `benchmark/` directory has been created for real benchmarking.
*   This directory contains a single script (`benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py`) that handles both generating model responses and evaluating them.
*   The script includes:
    *   Functionality to generate code for ARC tasks using a model
    *   Verification of the generated code against the task's test cases
    *   Detailed tracking of success/failure with counters
    *   Saving results to JSON files with information about whether the code was successful
    *   Concurrency control using `asyncio.Semaphore`
    *   Periodic and final result saving
    *   Detailed logging
    *   Signal handling for graceful shutdown
    *   Best-of flag to generate multiple responses for each task
    *   Consistent data structure with all responses stored as lists

## What's left to build

*   **Phase 2 (Synthetic Data Generation & Verification):**
    *   **Run Code Verification Script:** Execute `synthetic_data_generators/verify_generated_code.py` on the results from the code generation run (e.g., `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`) to assess the correctness of the generated code. (Next immediate step for Phase 2).
    *   **Analyze Verification Results:** Review the output and logs (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_verification.log`) from the verification script.
    *   **Analyze Reasoning Data:** Evaluate the quality of the `GEMINI_FLASH` reasoning from the reasoning data generation run (merged into `data/traces_store.json`).
    *   **Analyze Code Generation Results (Qualitative):** After verification, perform a qualitative review of the reasoning and code in `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`, especially for failed tasks.
    *   **Update `.gitignore`:** Add `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/` to `.gitignore`.
    *   **Consider Further Data Generation:** Decide if additional data generation runs are needed.
    *   **Refine Agents/Prompting:** Based on verification results and qualitative analysis, consider refinements.
*   **Phase 3 (Real Benchmarking):**
    *   **Run Benchmarking Script:** Execute `benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py` with appropriate parameters (e.g., `python benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py --model_identifier GEMINI_FLASH --max_tasks 10 --max_concurrent_tasks 3 --best_of 3`) to evaluate model performance on ARC tasks.
    *   **Analyze Benchmark Results:** Review the output and logs (`benchmark/benchmark_logs/code_benchmark_run.log`) from the benchmarking script, focusing on verification success rates and patterns of failures.
    *   **Compare Models:** Run the benchmark with different models to compare their performance.
    *   **Refine Benchmarking Process:** Based on initial results, consider refinements to the benchmarking process.

## Current status

*   **Phase 1 is complete.** The synthetic data generation interface is functional.
*   **Phase 2 implementation ongoing.**
    *   The reasoning data generation script (`synthetic_data_generators/generate_reasoning_data.py`) has been implemented, tested, and executed successfully with `GEMINI_FLASH`. Results merged into `data/traces_store.json`.
    *   The code data generation script (`synthetic_data_generators/generate_code_data.py`) has been implemented and executed successfully with `GEMINI_FLASH`. Results saved to `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`.
    *   The code verification script (`synthetic_data_generators/verify_generated_code.py`) has been implemented and refined to use embedded task data.
    *   Next step for Phase 2 is to run the code verification script.
*   **Phase 3 has been enhanced** with the following improvements:
    *   Added a best-of flag to the benchmark script to generate multiple responses for each task
    *   Updated the data structure to always store responses as lists for consistency
    *   Modified the merge_reasoning.py script to handle both list-based and string-based reasoning formats
    *   Standardized the JSON structure across all scripts for easier processing
    *   The script is ready for testing with different models and the new best-of feature.

## Known issues

*   Requires manual execution and testing with live model endpoints (`.env` needs valid API keys or local server running).
*   Performance and quality of output depend heavily on the chosen model and prompting strategy.
*   Potential for errors during API calls (network issues, invalid keys, rate limits) - check logs for details.
*   Optimal `max_concurrent_tasks` value may depend on the model API's rate limits, local system resources, and network latency.
*   Saving results requires write permissions to the relevant output directories.
*   The benchmark results quality will depend on the models used and the number of tasks processed.
*   When using best-of > 1, the current implementation only generates one response and stores it in a list. Future updates may need to modify the agent interface to support generating multiple responses with different parameters.
