# Progress

## What works

**Phase 1: Synthetic Data Generation Interface (Completed)**
*   Web-based testing interface (`apps/testing_interface.html`) for ARC tasks.
*   Functionality for task transformations (reflection, rotation, etc.).
*   Functionality for adding/managing reasoning traces.
*   Distance metric UI feedback.
*   Data structure definition (`data/nature_of_data.md`).

**Phase 2: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning (Implemented, Needs Testing)**
*   `benchmark/` directory structure established.
*   Core components implemented:
    *   `config.py`: Handles configuration (models, parameters, paths), now includes `use_dataset_json` flag.
    *   `data_loader.py`: Loads individual ARC task files and now also includes `load_tasks_from_dataset` for loading from `dataset.json`.
    *   `model_utils.py`: Manages model instantiation and API interactions (local/OpenRouter) with retries.
    *   `simple_agent.py`: Contains the agent logic for prompting the model.
    *   `run_benchmark.py`: Orchestrates the benchmark execution (async), now with command-line argument parsing (`argparse`, including `--use_dataset_json`, `--max_concurrent_tasks`), enhanced logging, logic to switch data loading methods, and **concurrency control using `asyncio.Semaphore`**.
*   Benchmark refinement:
    *   Enhanced logging (DEBUG level, file output) added across benchmark scripts.
    *   Added `max_concurrent_tasks` to `config.py` and CLI arguments.
    *   JSON output format improved (metadata, full prompts, model username).
*   Auxiliary utility created:
    *   `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py`: Merges benchmark reasoning into `data/traces_store.json`, storing reasoning in the `text` field and creating new entries for each merged reasoning trace for an existing task ID.
*   Memory Bank and `readme.md` updated to reflect both phases and recent changes.

## What's left to build (Phase 2)

*   Manually execute the benchmark with live model endpoints using both loading methods and varying concurrency levels:
    *   Individual files: `python benchmark/run_benchmark.py --model_identifier <MODEL> --max_tasks <N> --max_concurrent_tasks <C>`
    *   Dataset file: `python benchmark/run_benchmark.py --model_identifier <MODEL> --max_tasks <N> --use_dataset_json --task_directory ../data --max_concurrent_tasks <C>`
*   Analyze detailed logs (`benchmark_debug.log`) for any issues, verify correct concurrent execution, and check semaphore behavior.
*   Use the `merge_reasoning.py` script to integrate results into `data/traces_store.json`.
*   Analyze the merged reasoning data.
*   Potentially add more advanced analysis or reporting features later.

## Current status

*   **Phase 1 is complete.** The synthetic data generation interface is functional.
*   **Phase 2 is implemented and refined.** The benchmarking suite structure is complete, integrates model interaction logic, includes improved configuration, logging, and output formatting, supports loading tasks from both individual files and a single `dataset.json` file, and **now includes concurrency control**. It is ready for manual execution and testing against actual models using either data source and varying concurrency levels. The auxiliary reasoning merge script is also complete.

## Known issues (Phase 2)

*   Requires manual execution and testing with live model endpoints (`.env` needs valid API keys or local server running).
*   Performance and quality of reasoning output depend heavily on the chosen model and prompting strategy.
*   Potential for errors during API calls (network issues, invalid keys, rate limits) - check `benchmark_debug.log` for details.
*   Optimal `max_concurrent_tasks` value may depend on the model API's rate limits, local system resources, and network latency. Setting it too high might lead to errors or degraded performance.
