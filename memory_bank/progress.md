# Progress

## What works

**Phase 1: Synthetic Data Generation Interface (Completed)**
*   Web-based testing interface (`apps/testing_interface.html`) for ARC tasks.
*   Functionality for task transformations (reflection, rotation, etc.).
*   Functionality for adding/managing reasoning traces.
*   Distance metric UI feedback.
*   Data structure definition (`data/nature_of_data.md`).
*   Username authentication via cookie.
*   Application interfaces (`testing_interface.html`, `discuss_interface.html`) show main content by default, relying on the root welcome page (`/`).
*   Correct handling of `task_id` property in JavaScript.
*   Robust WebSocket connection handling in the testing interface.
*   Correct logout redirection to the root welcome page (`/`).
*   **OpenRouter API Integration in Discussion Interface:** The discussion interface (`apps/discuss_interface.html`) is now integrated with the OpenRouter API. This includes:
    *   A model selector dropdown to choose between different OpenRouter models.
    *   Using the user-provided API key to send messages to the selected model.
    *   Displaying AI responses in the chat interface.
    *   Handling the API key check before sending messages.
    *   Correctly loading and displaying tasks from `dataset.json`.
    *   Matching the dark theme of the application.
    *   Resolving the duplicate 'Grid' identifier error.
    *   **Implemented Temperature Slider:** Added a temperature slider to the API settings, allowing users to control the temperature parameter for AI responses. The selected temperature is saved in localStorage and passed to the OpenRouter API.
*   **Chat Memory in Discussion Interface:** Chat memory functionality has been successfully implemented. This includes:
    *   Username-based and task-specific memory storage using browser's localStorage.
    *   Persistent conversations across page refreshes and task changes.
    *   A "Clear History" button to delete conversation history for the current task.
    *   Automatic pruning of oldest conversations if localStorage is full.
    *   Saving and displaying system messages in the chat history.
*   **Python Code Execution in Discussion Interface:** A Python code execution environment has been successfully implemented within the discussion interface. This includes:
    *   A server-side endpoint (`/arc2/execute_code`) to execute Python code in a sandbox.
    *   A UI for code input, input grid, execution, and output display.
    *   The output display shows both a matrix representation and a visual grid representation of the execution result.
    *   Error handling and display for code execution failures.
    *   Automatic population of the input grid with the first test input.
    *   Guidance in the code placeholder on handling the 'shape' attribute error.
    *   **Improved Discussion Interface Layout and Space Allocation:** The layout of the discussion interface has been improved. Chat messages are now aligned to the left, and their maximum width has been increased to better utilize screen space. The heights of the code input and grid input areas have been reduced, and a scrollbar has been added to the code execution output area to allocate more space for the output.
    *   **Enforced 'solve_task' Function Name:** The requirement for the main function in code solutions to be named 'solve_task' has been enforced by updating the code input placeholder in the HTML and adding an instruction to the system message sent to the AI model.

**Phase 2: Synthetic Data Generation & Verification (Implemented, Needs Testing)**
*   `synthetic_data_generators/` directory structure established.
*   Core components implemented:
    *   `utilities/config.py`: Handles configuration (models, parameters, paths), now includes `use_dataset_json` flag.
    *   `utilities/data_loader.py`: Loads individual ARC task files and now also includes `load_tasks_from_dataset` for loading from `dataset.json`.
    *   `utilities/model_utils.py`: Manages model instantiation and API interactions (local/OpenRouter) with retries.
    *   `agents/reasoning_trace_generator.py`: Contains the agent logic for prompting the model for reasoning only.
    *   `agents/reasoning_code_generator.py`: Contains agent logic for prompting the model for both reasoning and Python code.
    *   `synthetic_data_generators/generate_reasoning_data.py`: Orchestrates the reasoning data generation using `ReasoningTraceGenerator` (async), with features like CLI args, concurrency control, periodic saving, and graceful exit.
    *   `synthetic_data_generators/generate_code_data.py`: Orchestrates the code data generation using `ReasoningCodeGenerator` (async), mirroring the features of the reasoning data script but saving both reasoning and code.
*   Data Generation refinement (applied to both scripts where applicable):
    *   Enhanced logging (DEBUG level, file output to `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data_generation.log` and `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data_generation.log`).
    *   Added `max_concurrent_tasks` to `utilities/config.py` and CLI arguments.
    *   JSON output format improved (metadata, full prompts, model username).
    *   Implemented periodic saving (every `SAVE_INTERVAL` tasks) to **append** new results to fixed files (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data/reasoning_data_partial_results.jsonl` or `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_partial_results.jsonl`) in **JSON Lines format**.
    *   Implemented final saving on normal exit (`atexit`) or interruption (`SIGINT`) to timestamped `.json` files (with distinct prefixes/paths like `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data/reasoning_data_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` and `_interrupted` suffix if needed), containing the full accumulated results.
    *   A simple file lock (`g_is_saving`) prevents concurrent save attempts during both periodic and final saves.
    *   **Crucially, the timestamp for the results file is generated once at the beginning of the script execution and stored in a global variable (`g_timestamp`). This prevents concurrent tasks from generating different timestamps and overwriting each other's results.**
*   Auxiliary utility created and used:
    *   `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py`: Merges reasoning data results into `data/traces_store.json`. Successfully used for the `GEMINI_FLASH` run. **Confirmed compatibility with the new list-based reasoning format.**
*   Memory Bank and `readme.md` updated to reflect both phases and recent changes.
*   **Reasoning Data Generation Execution:** Successfully ran `generate_reasoning_data.py` (`python synthetic_data_generators/generate_reasoning_data.py --model_identifier GEMINI_FLASH --max_tasks 15 --max_concurrent_tasks 3`).
    *   Verified periodic saving to `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data/reasoning_data_partial_results.jsonl`.
    *   Verified final results saved to `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data/reasoning_data_results_20250504_163628.json`.
    *   Checked logs (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data_generation.log`) for correct execution.
*   **Code Data Generation Creation & Execution:**
    *   Created `agents/reasoning_code_generator.py` with logic to request reasoning and Python code.
    *   Created `synthetic_data_generators/generate_code_data.py` based on the reasoning data script, adapting it to use `ReasoningCodeGenerator` and save both reasoning and code.
    *   Successfully ran the script: `python synthetic_data_generators/generate_code_data.py --model_identifier GEMINI_FLASH --max_tasks 10 --max_concurrent_tasks 3`.
    *   Verified periodic saving to `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_partial_results.jsonl`.
    *   Verified final results saved to `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`.
    *   Checked logs (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data_generation.log`) for correct execution.
    *   **Confirmed that this script does not have "best of" functionality.**
    *   **Now supports filtering tasks by ID using the `--task_ids` command-line argument (accepts a JSON string).**
*   **Code Verification Script:**
    *   Created `synthetic_data_generators/verify_generated_code.py` to execute generated Python code against ARC task test cases.
    *   Refined the script to use `task_data` embedded directly within the data generation results file, removing the need to load a separate `dataset.json`.
*   **Agent Structure Refactoring:**
    *   Created `agents/` directory.
    *   Moved `benchmark/simple_agent.py` to `agents/reasoning_trace_generator.py`. (Note: This move was part of a previous refactor, kept for historical context if needed).
    *   Moved `benchmark/code_generating_agent.py` to `agents/reasoning_code_generator.py`. (Note: This move was part of a previous refactor, kept for historical context if needed).
    *   Updated import paths in `synthetic_data_generators/generate_reasoning_data.py` and `synthetic_data_generators/generate_code_data.py`.
    *   Updated `memory_bank/systemPatterns.md` and `memory_bank/activeContext.md` to reflect the new structure.

**Phase 3: Real Benchmarking (Implemented, Needs Testing)**
*   A new `benchmark/` directory has been created for real benchmarking.
*   This directory contains two scripts for different benchmarking approaches:
    *   `benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py`: Generates and evaluates Python code solutions
    *   `benchmark/run_direct_benchmark.py`: Generates and evaluates direct grid answers without code
*   Both scripts include:
    *   Functionality to generate responses for ARC tasks using a model
    *   Verification of the generated code/answers against the task's test cases
    *   Detailed tracking of success/failure with counters
    *   Saving results to JSON files with information about whether the code/answers were successful. **The timestamp for the results file is generated once at the beginning of the script execution and stored in a global variable (`g_timestamp`). This prevents concurrent tasks from generating different timestamps and overwriting each other's results.**
    *   Concurrency control using `asyncio.Semaphore`
    *   Periodic and final result saving
    *   Detailed logging
    *   Signal handling for graceful shutdown
    *   Best-of flag to generate multiple responses for each task. **The issue where this was not processing multiple attempts has been identified and fixed.**
    *   Consistent data structure with all responses stored as lists.
    *   The code benchmark uses `CodeGeneratingAgent` to generate Python code that is executed and verified.
    *   The direct answer benchmark uses `DirectAnswerAgent` to generate output grids that are directly compared to expected outputs.
    *   **Fixed Delayed Argument Parsing Error:** Identified and removed duplicate argument parsing blocks in `benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py`, `benchmark/run_direct_benchmark.py`, `synthetic_data_generators/generate_code_data.py`, and `synthetic_data_generators/generate_reasoning_data.py`.
    *   **Added Solved/Unsolved Task IDs to Benchmark Metadata:** Modified the `save_final_results` function in `benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py` and `benchmark/run_direct_benchmark.py` to include lists of solved and unsolved task IDs in the metadata.

## What's left to build

*   **Phase 2 (Synthetic Data Generation & Verification):**
    *   **Run Code Verification Script:** Execute `synthetic_data_generators/verify_generated_code.py` on the results from the code generation run (e.g., `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`) to assess the correctness of the generated code. (Next immediate step for Phase 2).
    *   **Analyze Verification Results:** Review the output and logs (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_verification.log`) from the verification script.
    *   **Analyze Reasoning Data:** Evaluate the quality of the `GEMINI_FLASH` reasoning from the reasoning data generation run (merged into `data/traces_store.json`).
    *   **Analyze Code Generation Results (Qualitative):** After verification, perform a qualitative review of the reasoning and code in `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`, especially for failed tasks.
    *   **Update `.gitignore`:** Add `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/` to `.gitignore`.
    *   **Consider Further Data Generation:** Decide if additional data generation runs are needed.
    *   **Refine Agents/Prompting:** Based on verification results and qualitative analysis, consider refinements.
*   **Phase 3 (Real Benchmarking):**
    *   **Run Code Benchmarking Script:** Execute `benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py` with appropriate parameters (e.g., `python benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py --model_identifier GEMINI_FLASH --max_tasks 10 --max_concurrent_tasks 3 --best_of 3`) to evaluate model performance on ARC tasks, now with the corrected "best of" functionality.
    *   **Run Direct Answer Benchmarking Script:** Execute `benchmark/run_direct_benchmark.py` with similar parameters to evaluate model performance on directly generating answers without code.
    *   Test the best-of flag with both benchmark scripts to generate multiple responses for each task.
    *   Compare the results between the code-based and direct answer approaches.
    *   Analyze the benchmark results, which include information about whether the generated code/answers were successful.
    *   Consider refinements to the benchmarking process based on initial results.
*   **Phase 1 (Synthetic Data Generation Interface):**
    *   **Enhance Discussion Interface:** Add features like markdown rendering, etc.
    *   **Testing and Refinement:** Test the complete workflow and interfaces.
    *   **Documentation:** Update project documentation.

## Current status

*   **Phase 1 is complete.** The synthetic data generation interface is functional, with username authentication, correct task ID handling, robust WebSocket connections (with reverse proxy), and correct logout redirection implemented. The discussion interface is now integrated with the OpenRouter API for sending messages and receiving responses, including model selection, API key handling, task loading, dark theme, and resolved the duplicate 'Grid' identifier error. Ensured full conversation history is sent to the AI model for better context. The layout has been improved for better visibility of examples and chat area, automatic population of the input grid with the first test input is implemented, and code block formatting to preserve indentation in AI messages is added.
*   **Phase 2 implementation ongoing.**
    *   The reasoning data generation script (`synthetic_data_generators/generate_reasoning_data.py`) has been implemented, tested, and executed successfully with `GEMINI_FLASH`. Results merged into `data/traces_store.json`.
    *   The code data generation script (`synthetic_data_generators/generate_code_data.py`) has been implemented and executed successfully with `GEMINI_FLASH`. Results saved to `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`. **Confirmed that this script does not have "best of" functionality.** **Now supports filtering tasks by ID using the `--task_ids` command-line argument (accepts a JSON string).**
    *   The code verification script (`synthetic_data_generators/verify_generated_code.py`) has been implemented and refined to use embedded task data.
    *   Next step for Phase 2 is to run the code verification script.
*   **Phase 3 has been enhanced** with the following improvements:
    *   Added a best-of flag to the benchmark scripts to generate multiple responses for each task. **The issue where this was not processing multiple attempts has been identified and fixed.**
    *   Created a new direct answer benchmark script (`benchmark/run_direct_benchmark.py`) and agent (`agents/direct_answer_generator.py`) for evaluating models on directly generating grid answers without code.
    *   Updated the data structure to always store responses as lists for consistency.
    *   Modified the merge_reasoning.py script to handle both list-based and string-based reasoning formats. **Confirmed compatibility with the new list-based reasoning format.**
    *   Standardized the JSON structure across all scripts for easier processing.
    *   Both benchmark scripts are ready for testing with different models and the new best-of feature. **Now support filtering tasks by ID using the `--task_ids` command-line argument (accepts a JSON string).**

## Known issues

*   Requires manual execution and testing with live model endpoints (`.env` needs valid API keys or local server running).
*   Performance and quality of output depend heavily on the chosen model and prompting strategy.
*   Potential for errors during API calls (network issues, invalid keys, rate limits) - check logs for details.
*   Optimal `max_concurrent_tasks` value may depend on the model API's rate limits, local system resources, and network latency.
*   Saving results requires write permissions to the relevant output directories.
*   The benchmark results quality will depend on the models used and the number of tasks processed.
*   When using best-of > 1, the current implementation generates multiple responses but doesn't yet implement sophisticated selection strategies between them. Future updates may need to modify the agent interfaces to support generating multiple responses with different parameters and selecting the best one.
*   The direct answer benchmark relies on the model correctly formatting its output as a valid JSON grid. If the model fails to produce properly formatted output, the answer will be considered incorrect even if the reasoning is sound.
*   **Deployment with `/arc2/` URL Prefix and WebSockets:** Correct functioning of WebSocket connections when the application is served under the `/arc2/` URL prefix in deployment is dependent on the reverse proxy being correctly configured to proxy WebSocket traffic to the backend's default `/socket.io/` path.

Now that you have the latest state of the file, try the operation again with fewer, more precise SEARCH blocks. For large files especially, it may be prudent to try to limit yourself to <5 SEARCH/REPLACE blocks at a time, then wait for the user to respond with the result of the operation before following up with another replace_in_file call to make additional edits.
(If you run into this error 3 times in a row, you may use the write_to_file tool as a fallback.)
