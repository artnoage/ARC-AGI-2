# Progress

## What works

**Synthetic Data Creation Interfaces (Completed and Tested)**
* Web-based testing interface (`apps/testing_interface.html`) for ARC tasks
* Task transformation functionality (reflection, rotation, etc.)
* Reasoning trace management
* Distance metric UI feedback
* Username authentication via cookie
* WebSocket connection handling
* Logout redirection
* OpenRouter API integration in discussion interface:
  * Model selector dropdown
  * Temperature control slider
  * Full conversation history context
* Navigation improvements in discussion interface:
  * "Go to Task #" functionality added
  * Optimized layout with side-by-side navigation controls
  * Repositioned execution buttons for better space utilization
  * Added task name display in header that updates when task changes
  * Fixed horizontal scrolling in code execution panel to preserve header position
  * Redesigned settings panel with compact layout (70% height reduction)
  * Restructured settings panel into three vertical columns ("API Settings", "Navigation", and "Execution Controls")
  * Made sliders shorter to fit better in the compact panels
* Chat memory functionality:
  * Username and task-specific storage
  * Persistent conversations
  * Memory management
* Python code execution environment:
  * Server-side code execution endpoint
  * Input/output grid visualization
  * Error handling and display
  * Improved layout and controls

**Synthetic Data Generation & Verification (Implemented, Needs Testing)**
* Core components implemented:
  * `utilities/config.py`: Configuration management
  * `utilities/data_loader.py`: Data loading with multiple methods
  * `utilities/model_utils.py`: Model interaction with retries
  * `agents/reasoning_trace_generator.py`: Reasoning generation logic
  * `agents/reasoning_code_generator.py`: Code generation logic
  * `synthetic_data_generators/generate_reasoning_data.py`: Reasoning orchestration
  * `synthetic_data_generators/generate_code_data.py`: Code generation orchestration
  * `synthetic_data_generators/verify_generated_code.py`: Code verification
* Enhanced features:
  * Detailed logging
  * Concurrency control
  * Periodic saving to JSONL files
  * Final saving with timestamps
  * Task filtering via `--task_ids` argument
* Successfully executed:
  * Reasoning trace generation with GEMINI_FLASH model
  * Code generation with GEMINI_FLASH model
  * Auxiliary utility for merging reasoning data

**LLM Benchmarking (Completed and Tested)**
* Two benchmark approaches implemented:
  * `benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py`: Code-based evaluation
  * `benchmark/run_direct_benchmark.py`: Direct answer evaluation
* Features include:
  * Model response generation
  * Verification against test cases
  * Success/failure tracking
  * Detailed result saving
  * Concurrency control
  * Periodic and final saving
  * Signal handling for graceful shutdown
  * "Best-of" functionality for multiple attempts
  * Solved/unsolved task ID tracking
  * Task filtering via `--task_ids` argument

## What's left to build

**Synthetic Data Generation & Verification**
* Run code verification script on generated solutions
* Analyze verification results and code quality
* Consider additional data generation runs with different models
* Update `.gitignore` to exclude synthetic data directory
* Potentially refine agent prompting based on results

**LLM Benchmarking**
* Run comprehensive benchmarks with multiple models
* Compare code-based vs. direct answer approaches
* Analyze performance patterns across different task types
* Consider refinements to benchmarking process

**Synthetic Data Creation Interfaces**
* Consider additional enhancements (markdown rendering, etc.)
* Conduct final testing of complete workflow
* Update documentation

## Current status

**Synthetic Data Creation Interfaces** are complete and functional, with all planned features implemented and tested.

**Synthetic Data Generation & Verification** implementation is nearly complete:
* Reasoning and code generation scripts have been successfully executed with GEMINI_FLASH
* Code verification script is implemented but needs to be run on generated solutions
* Next step is to run verification and analyze results

**LLM Benchmarking** is ready for comprehensive testing:
* Both code-based and direct answer benchmark scripts are implemented
* "Best-of" functionality is working correctly
* Scripts are ready for testing with different models and parameters

## Known issues

* **Deployment with `/arc2/` URL Prefix and WebSockets:** Correct functioning of WebSocket connections when the application is served under the `/arc2/` URL prefix in deployment is dependent on the reverse proxy being correctly configured to proxy WebSocket traffic to the backend's default `/socket.io/` path.
