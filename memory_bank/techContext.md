# Tech Context

## Technologies used

*   Python: For implementing the agent.
*   ARC Dataset (JSON format): The data source for benchmarking.
*   (Placeholder for Model Technology): The specific model to be used is TBD.

## Development setup

*   Standard Python environment.
*   Access to the ARC dataset files (`data/dataset.json` or individual files in `data/training/`).

## Technical constraints

*   The `data/dataset.json` file is large and cannot be read entirely into memory at once. Processing will need to handle this (e.g., reading individual task files or streaming).
*   Integration with the model will depend on the model's API and requirements.

## Dependencies

*   Standard Python libraries (e.g., `json`).
*   (Potential model SDK/library dependency)
