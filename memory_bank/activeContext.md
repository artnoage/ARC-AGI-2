# Active Context
## Current work focus

The project is currently focused on enhancing the user interface to provide two distinct interaction modes: task solving and AI discussion. This involves creating a central welcome page and modifying the existing and new interface pages to integrate with this new flow and ensure correct data loading based on the dataset structure. We have recently completed implementing username authentication, updating task ID references, fixing issues related to WebSocket connections and logout redirection, and integrating OpenRouter API functionality into the discussion interface.

## Recent changes

*   **Implemented Username Authentication and Interface Initialization:**
    *   Removed the internal welcome screen logic from `apps/static/js/testing_interface.js` and `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js`.

*   **Enforced 'solve_task' Function Name:**
    *   Updated the code input placeholder in the HTML to explicitly state that the main function should be named 'solve_task'.
    *   Added an instruction to the system message sent to the AI model to use 'solve_task' as the main function name in code solutions.

## Next steps

*   **Phase 2 (Synthetic Data Generation & Verification):**
    *   **Run Code Verification Script:** Execute `synthetic_data_generators/verify_generated_code.py` on the results from the code generation run (e.g., `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`) to assess the correctness of the generated code. (Next immediate step for Phase 2).
    *   **Analyze Verification Results:** Review the output and logs (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_verification.log`) from the verification script.
    *   **Analyze Reasoning Data:** Evaluate the quality of the `GEMINI_FLASH` reasoning from the reasoning data generation run (merged into `data/traces_store.json`).
    *   **Analyze Code Generation Results (Qualitative):** After verification, perform a qualitative review of the reasoning and code in `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`, especially for failed tasks.
    *   **Update `.gitignore`:** Add `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/` to `.gitignore`.
    *   **Consider Further Data Generation:** Decide if additional data generation runs are needed.
    *   **Refine Agents/Prompting:** Based on verification results and qualitative analysis, consider refinements.
*   **Phase 3 (Real Benchmarking):**
    *   **Run Code Benchmarking Script:** Execute `benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py` with appropriate parameters (e.g., `python benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py --model_identifier GEMINI_FLASH --max_tasks 10 --max_concurrent_tasks 3 --best_of 3`) to evaluate model performance on ARC tasks, now with the corrected "best of" functionality.
    *   **Run Direct Answer Benchmarking Script:** Execute `benchmark/run_direct_benchmark.py` with similar parameters to evaluate model performance on directly generating answers without code.
    *   Test the best-of flag with both benchmark scripts to generate multiple responses for each task.
    *   Compare the results between the code-based and direct answer approaches.
    *   Analyze the benchmark results, which include information about whether the generated code/answers were successful.
    *   Consider refinements to the benchmarking process based on initial results.
*   **Phase 1 (Synthetic Data Generation Interface):**
    *   **Enhance Discussion Interface:** Add features like markdown rendering, etc.
    *   **Testing and Refinement:** Test the complete workflow and interfaces.
    *   **Documentation:** Update project documentation.

## Active decisions and considerations

*   **Interface Separation:** Three distinct interfaces with separate HTML, CSS, and JS files.
*   **Dataset Loading:** Unified dataset loaded from `/arc2/static/dataset.json`. Task data stored in memory.
*   **Navigation Structure:** Uses `/arc2/` prefix for deployment compatibility. Server routes updated to handle this.
*   **User Experience:** Centralized username input on the welcome page, stored in a cookie. Interfaces redirect to the root URL (`/`) if no username is found. OpenRouter API key stored locally.
*   **AI Integration (Implemented):** Discussion interface is now integrated with the OpenRouter API for sending messages and receiving responses, including model selection, API key handling, task loading, dark theme, and resolved the duplicate 'Grid' identifier error. **Added temperature control via a slider.** Ensured full conversation history is sent to the AI model for better context.
*   **Task Demonstration:** Consistent visual format for task display. Improved layout for better visibility of examples and chat area.
*   **Responsive Design:** Interfaces are designed to be responsive.
*   **File Modification Issues:** Encountered difficulties with automated JavaScript file modifications, requiring manual intervention for critical changes.
*   **Task ID Property:** Confirmed that the task identifier property in `apps/static/dataset.json` is `task_id`, not `id`. This has been corrected in the JavaScript files.
*   **WebSocket and Deployment:** The client-side now uses the default `/socket.io/` path for WebSocket connections, relying on reverse proxy configuration to handle the `/arc2/` prefix in deployment.
*   **Code Execution Environment (Implemented):** A Python code execution environment is now available within the discussion interface, allowing users to test code solutions against input grids. The execution happens server-side in a sandbox. The output display shows both a matrix and a visual representation of the result. Added guidance in the code placeholder on handling the 'shape' attribute error.
*   **Code Block Formatting (Implemented):** Added code block formatting to preserve indentation in AI messages.
