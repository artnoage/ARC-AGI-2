    *   Updated `apps/static/css/discuss_interface.css` to style the new model selector.
    *   Modified `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js` to use the `openrouter_api.js` functions for sending messages and to handle the API key check before sending.
    *   Fixed duplicate `SELECTED_MODEL` variable declaration in `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js`.
    *   **Implemented Temperature Slider:** Added a temperature slider to the API settings in `apps/discuss_interface.html`, styled it in `apps/static/css/discuss_interface.css`, and added JavaScript logic in `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js` to handle input, display the value, save to localStorage, and pass the value to the OpenRouter API call.
*   **Implemented Chat Memory in Discussion Interface:**
    *   Added local storage-based chat memory functionality to `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js`.
    *   Memory is specific to each user and task.

    *   Modified task loading to display relevant chat history.
*   **Implemented Python Code Execution in Discussion Interface:**
    *   Added a new route `/arc2/execute_code` in `server.py` to handle code execution requests using the `utilities.code_execution.execute_generated_code` function.
    *   Added a new "Python Code Execution" section to `apps/discuss_interface.html` with areas for code input, input grid (JSON), execute button, status, and output display.
    *   Added CSS styles for the code execution area in `apps/static/css/discuss_interface.css`, including making the panel thinner and styling the input/output areas.
    *   Added JavaScript functions in `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js` to handle the execute button click, send code and input grid to the server via AJAX, and display the execution results (output grid or error message).
    *   Modified the output display to show both a matrix representation and a visual grid representation side-by-side.
    *   Implemented automatic population of the input grid with the first test input.
    *   Added guidance in the code placeholder on handling the 'shape' attribute error.
*   **Improved Discussion Interface Layout and Space Allocation:**
    *   Modified CSS to align chat messages to the left and increase their maximum width.
    *   Adjusted heights and added a scrollbar to the code execution output area to allocate more space.
*   **Enforced 'solve_task' Function Name:**
    *   Updated the code input placeholder in the HTML to explicitly state that the main function should be named 'solve_task'.
    *   Added an instruction to the system message sent to the AI model to use 'solve_task' as the main function name in code solutions.

## Next steps

*   **Phase 2 (Synthetic Data Generation & Verification):**
    *   **Run Code Verification Script:** Execute `synthetic_data_generators/verify_generated_code.py` on the results from the code generation run (e.g., `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`) to assess the correctness of the generated code. (Next immediate step for Phase 2).
    *   **Analyze Verification Results:** Review the output and logs (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_verification.log`) from the verification script.
    *   **Analyze Reasoning Data:** Evaluate the quality of the `GEMINI_FLASH` reasoning from the reasoning data generation run (merged into `data/traces_store.json`).
    *   **Analyze Code Generation Results (Qualitative):** After verification, perform a qualitative review of the reasoning and code in `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`, especially for failed tasks.
    *   **Update `.gitignore`:** Add `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/` to `.gitignore`.
    *   **Consider Further Data Generation:** Decide if additional data generation runs are needed.
    *   **Refine Agents/Prompting:** Based on verification results and qualitative analysis, consider refinements.

## Active decisions and considerations

*   **Interface Separation:** Three distinct interfaces with separate HTML, CSS, and JS files.
*   **Dataset Loading:** Unified dataset loaded from `/arc2/static/dataset.json`. Task data stored in memory.
*   **Navigation Structure:** Uses `/arc2/` prefix for deployment compatibility. Server routes updated to handle this.
*   **User Experience:** Centralized username input on the welcome page, stored in a cookie. Interfaces redirect to the root URL (`/`) if no username is found. OpenRouter API key stored locally.
*   **AI Integration (Implemented):** Discussion interface is now integrated with the OpenRouter API for sending messages and receiving responses, including model selection, API key handling, task loading, dark theme, and resolved the duplicate 'Grid' identifier error. **Added temperature control via a slider.** Ensured full conversation history is sent to the AI model for better context.
*   **Task Demonstration:** Consistent visual format for task display. Improved layout for better visibility of examples and chat area.
*   **Responsive Design:** Interfaces are designed to be responsive.
*   **File Modification Issues:** Encountered difficulties with automated JavaScript file modifications, requiring manual intervention for critical changes.
*   **Task ID Property:** Confirmed that the task identifier property in `apps/static/dataset.json` is `task_id`, not `id`. This has been corrected in the JavaScript files.
*   **WebSocket and Deployment:** The client-side now uses the default `/socket.io/` path for WebSocket connections, relying on reverse proxy configuration to handle the `/arc2/` prefix in deployment.
*   **Code Execution Environment (Implemented):** A Python code execution environment is now available within the discussion interface, allowing users to test code solutions against input grids. The execution happens server-side in a sandbox. The output display shows both a matrix and a visual representation of the result. Added guidance in the code placeholder on handling the 'shape' attribute error.
*   **Code Block Formatting (Implemented):** Added code block formatting to preserve indentation in AI messages.
