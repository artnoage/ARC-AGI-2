# Active Context
## Current work focus

The project is currently focused on enhancing the user interface to provide two distinct interaction modes: task solving and AI discussion. This involves creating a central welcome page and modifying the existing and new interface pages to integrate with this new flow and ensure correct data loading based on the dataset structure. We are currently troubleshooting issues with loading the dataset due to a discrepancy in the task ID property name and issues with automated JavaScript file modifications.

## Recent changes

*   **Created New Discuss Interface:**
    *   Created `apps/discuss_interface.html` for the AI discussion interface.
    *   Created `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js` for the discussion interface functionality.
    *   Created `apps/static/css/discuss_interface.css` for the discussion interface styling.
    *   Implemented task demonstration area and chat interface.
    *   Added API key input for OpenRouter integration.
    *   Implemented simulated AI responses.
*   **Updated Main Interface:**
    *   Modified `data/index.html` to serve as the central welcome page with username input and navigation buttons.
    *   Added JavaScript logic to `data/index.html` to handle username input, set a cookie, and navigate.
    *   Added jQuery library to `data/index.html`.
    *   Updated styling for the welcome page.
*   **Updated Task Interfaces (HTML):**
    *   Removed the internal welcome screen and username prompts from `apps/testing_interface.html`.
    *   Removed the internal welcome screen and username prompts from `apps/discuss_interface.html`.
    *   Ensured the main content of both interfaces is visible by default.
    *   Updated CSS and JavaScript links in both files to use the `/arc2/static/` prefix.
*   **Fixed Navigation and Routing:**
    *   Ensured all links use the correct `/arc2/` prefix for deployment compatibility.
    *   Added a new route in `server.py` (`@app.route('/arc2/apps/<path:filename>')`) to serve files from the `apps` directory with the `/arc2/apps/` prefix.
    *   Corrected the root route (`@app.route('/')`) in `server.py` to serve `data/index.html`.
*   **Enhanced Benchmark and Synthetic Data Generation (Previous):**
    *   **Standardized JSON Structure:** Modified all scripts to use a single JSONL file for results.
    *   **Added Best-of Flag to Benchmark Script (Initial Implementation):** Added `--best_of` argument and stored responses as lists.
    *   **Updated Merge Reasoning Script (Initial Update):** Modified `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py` to handle list-based reasoning and JSONL.
*   **Completed Refactoring of Synthetic Data Generation Structure (Previous):** Renamed directories and scripts, updated paths and documentation.
*   **Created New Benchmark Directory (Previous):** Created a new `benchmark/` directory for real benchmarking.
*   **Previous Work (Pre-Refactor):** Established core components, implemented features like concurrency, saving, logging, and refined JSON output.
*   **Fixed Delayed Argument Parsing Error:** Removed duplicate argument parsing blocks.
*   **Added Solved/Unsolved Task IDs to Benchmark Metadata:** Included lists of solved and unsolved task IDs in benchmark metadata.

## Next steps

*   **Manual Code Changes (User Action Required):**
    *   **Update Task ID Property:** Manually change all instances of `.id` to `.task_id` when accessing task identifiers from the dataset in both `apps/static/js/testing_interface.js` and `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js`. Update related warning messages.
    *   **Implement Username Check/Redirect:** Manually add the username cookie check and redirect logic at the beginning of the `$(document).ready()` function in both `apps/static/js/testing_interface.js` and `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js`.
*   **Implement OpenRouter API Integration:** Connect the discuss interface to the OpenRouter API.
*   **Enhance Discussion Interface:** Add features like chat history, markdown rendering, etc.
*   **Testing and Refinement:** Test the complete workflow and interfaces.
*   **Documentation:** Update project documentation.

## Active decisions and considerations

*   **Interface Separation:** Three distinct interfaces with separate HTML, CSS, and JS files.
*   **Dataset Loading:** Unified dataset loaded from `/arc2/static/dataset.json`. Task data stored in memory.
*   **Navigation Structure:** Uses `/arc2/` prefix for deployment compatibility. Server routes updated to handle this.
*   **User Experience:** Centralized username input on the welcome page, stored in a cookie. Interfaces redirect if no username is found. OpenRouter API key stored locally.
*   **AI Integration (Planned):** Discussion interface is set up for future API integration.
*   **Task Demonstration:** Consistent visual format for task display.
*   **Responsive Design:** Interfaces are designed to be responsive.
*   **File Modification Issues:** Encountered difficulties with automated JavaScript file modifications, requiring manual intervention for critical changes.
*   **Task ID Property:** Confirmed that the task identifier property in `apps/static/dataset.json` is `task_id`, not `id`. This requires manual correction in the JavaScript files.
