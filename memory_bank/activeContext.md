# Active Context

## Current work focus

The project is currently in **Phase 2: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning**. Following the completion of the synthetic data generation interface (Phase 1), the focus is now on implementing, testing, and refining the benchmarking suite to evaluate language model reasoning on ARC tasks.

## Recent changes (Phase 2)

*   Established the `benchmark/` directory structure.
*   Implemented core benchmarking components:
    *   `config.py`: Handles configuration (models, parameters, paths).
    *   `data_loader.py`: Loads individual ARC task files.
    *   `model_utils.py`: Manages model instantiation and API interactions (local/OpenRouter) with retries.
    *   `simple_agent.py`: Contains the agent logic for prompting the model for reasoning only.
    *   `code_generating_agent.py`: Contains agent logic for prompting the model for both reasoning and Python code.
    *   `generate_reasoning_traces.py` (formerly `run_benchmark.py`): Orchestrates the reasoning trace generation execution using `SimpleAgent` (async).
    *   `run_code_generation_benchmark.py`: Orchestrates the code generation benchmark execution using `CodeGeneratingAgent` (async), saving both reasoning and code.
*   Refined benchmark components:
    *   Added command-line argument parsing (`argparse`) to both `generate_reasoning_traces.py` and `run_code_generation_benchmark.py` for dynamic configuration (`--model_identifier`, `--max_tasks`, etc.).
    *   Enhanced logging (DEBUG level, file output to `benchmark_debug.log`) across benchmark scripts.
    *   Improved JSON output format to include metadata (model username, timestamp, etc.) and the full prompt messages sent to the model.
*   Refined auxiliary script `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py` to merge benchmark reasoning into `data/traces_store.json`, ensuring reasoning is stored in the `text` field and new entries are created for each merged reasoning trace for an existing task ID.
        *   Updated Memory Bank files to reflect project history and current phase.
        *   Updated `readme.md` to include documentation for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 (including benchmark usage).
        *   **Added support for loading tasks from a single `dataset.json` file:** (Applies to both benchmark scripts)
            *   Added `use_dataset_json` flag to `benchmark/config.py`.
            *   Added `--use_dataset_json` command-line argument to both benchmark scripts.
            *   Implemented `load_tasks_from_dataset` function in `benchmark/data_loader.py`.
            *   Updated both benchmark scripts to use the appropriate data loading function based on the flag.
        *   **Implemented concurrency control:** (Applies to both benchmark scripts)
            *   Added `max_concurrent_tasks` field to `benchmark/config.py`.
            *   Added `--max_concurrent_tasks` command-line argument to both benchmark scripts.
            *   Used `asyncio.Semaphore` in both benchmark scripts to limit concurrent task processing.
            *   **Fixed large dataset loading:** Modified both benchmark scripts to iterate over the `load_tasks_from_dataset` generator directly when `use_dataset_json` is true, avoiding loading the entire dataset into memory.
            *   **Implemented Periodic Saving & Graceful Exit:** (Applies to both benchmark scripts)
                *   Added global variables (`g_results`, counters, config, etc.) to both benchmark scripts to manage state across tasks.
                *   Implemented `save_periodic_results` function to save partial results every `SAVE_INTERVAL` successful tasks (using distinct partial filenames: `benchmark_partial_results.jsonl` and `code_gen_benchmark_partial_results.jsonl`).
                *   Implemented `save_final_results` function, registered with `atexit`, to save all results upon normal completion or interruption (using distinct final filenames).
                *   Implemented a `signal_handler` for `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) that calls `save_final_results` before exiting.
                *   Modified `process_single_task` in both scripts to update global results and counters, and trigger periodic saves.
                *   Refactored the main async functions in both scripts to rely on global state and exit handlers for result saving.
                *   **Modified periodic saving:** Changed `save_periodic_results` in both scripts to **append** new results to their respective partial files (`.jsonl` format). Global counters (`g_last_saved_results_len`) track saved results.
                *   **Updated Agent Prompt:** Modified the system prompt in `benchmark/simple_agent.py` to include a mapping of grid numbers (0-9) to their corresponding color names. (Note: `code_generating_agent.py` uses a different prompt structure).
        *   **Executed Reasoning Trace Generation:** Successfully ran the `generate_reasoning_traces.py` script using `python benchmark/generate_reasoning_traces.py --model_identifier GEMINI_FLASH --max_tasks 15 --max_concurrent_tasks 3`.
            *   Verified periodic saving to `benchmark_partial_results.jsonl`.
            *   Verified final results saved to `benchmark/benchmark_results/benchmark_results_20250504_163628.json`.
            *   Checked logs (`benchmark_debug.log`) for correct execution.
        *   **Merged Reasoning Results:** Successfully used `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py` to integrate the reasoning benchmark output (`benchmark_results_20250504_163628.json`) into `data/traces_store.json`.
        *   **Created and Executed Code Generation Benchmark:**
            *   Created `benchmark/code_generating_agent.py` with logic to request reasoning and Python code.
            *   Created `benchmark/run_code_generation_benchmark.py` based on the reasoning trace script, adapting it to use `CodeGeneratingAgent` and save both reasoning and Python code.
            *   Successfully ran the script: `python benchmark/run_code_generation_benchmark.py --model_identifier GEMINI_FLASH --max_tasks 10 --max_concurrent_tasks 3`.
            *   Verified periodic saving to `code_gen_benchmark_partial_results.jsonl`.
            *   Verified final results saved to `benchmark/benchmark_results/code_gen_benchmark_results_20250504_165606.json`.
            *   Checked logs (`code_gen_benchmark_debug.log`) for correct execution.
        *   **Created Code Verification Script:** Implemented `benchmark/verify_generated_code.py` to execute generated Python code against ARC task test cases.

## Next steps (Phase 2)

*   **Run Code Verification Script:** Execute `benchmark/verify_generated_code.py` on the results from the code generation benchmark (`code_gen_benchmark_results_20250504_165606.json`) to assess the correctness of the generated code. (Next immediate step).
*   **Analyze Verification Results:** Review the output and logs (`code_verification_debug.log`) from the verification script.
*   **Analyze Reasoning Data:** Review the merged reasoning data in `data/traces_store.json` (from the reasoning benchmark run).
*   **Analyze Code Generation Results (Qualitative):** Review the raw output JSON (`code_gen_benchmark_results_...json`) for qualitative insights into reasoning and code structure, especially for tasks that failed verification.
*   **Update Memory Bank:** Update `progress.md` to reflect the creation and execution of the verification script. (`activeContext.md` is now updated).
*   **Consider Further Benchmarks:** Decide if additional benchmark runs are needed.
*   **Refine Agents/Prompting:** Based on verification results and qualitative analysis, consider refinements.

## Active decisions and considerations (Phase 2)

*   Model selection and parameters are centralized in `benchmark/config.py`.
*   Error handling for model API calls and file I/O is implemented.
*   The benchmark currently focuses on generating reasoning for 'train' examples only.
*   **Data loading now supports two methods:**
    *   Loading individual task files from a directory (default).
    *   Loading tasks *iteratively* from a single `dataset.json` file (using `--use_dataset_json` flag). This avoids loading the entire dataset into memory at once.
*   Benchmark configuration is now handled via a combination of `config.py` defaults and command-line argument overrides.
*   JSON output includes detailed metadata and the full prompt structure.
*   **Concurrency control:** `asyncio.Semaphore` is used in both benchmark scripts (`generate_reasoning_traces.py`, `run_code_generation_benchmark.py`) to limit the number of tasks processed simultaneously, controlled by `max_concurrent_tasks` in the configuration (defaulting to 5, overrideable via CLI).
*   **Result Saving:** (Applies conceptually to both benchmark scripts, with different filenames)
    *   Results are accumulated in a global list (`g_results`).
    *   **Partial results:** New results are appended periodically (every `SAVE_INTERVAL` successful tasks) to fixed files (`benchmark_partial_results.jsonl` or `code_gen_benchmark_partial_results.jsonl`) in JSON Lines format. Global counters (`g_last_saved_results_len`) prevent duplicate entries.
    *   **Final results:** All accumulated results (`g_results`) are saved upon normal exit (`atexit`) or interruption (`SIGINT`) to timestamped `.json` files (with distinct prefixes and `_interrupted` suffix if applicable), containing metadata and the full list of results.
    *   A simple file lock (`g_is_saving`) prevents concurrent save attempts during both periodic and final saves.
*   **Agent Prompting:**
    *   The `SimpleAgent` uses a system prompt that includes guidance on the number-to-color mapping.
    *   The `CodeGeneratingAgent` uses a different prompt structure designed to elicit both reasoning and Python code.
