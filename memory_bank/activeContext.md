# Active Context
## Current work focus

The project is currently focused on two main areas: **Phase 2: Synthetic Data Generation & Verification** and **Phase 3: Real Benchmarking**.

The refactoring of the synthetic data generation structure (formerly the `benchmark/` directory) to `synthetic_data_generators/` is complete. This included renaming directories and scripts, updating internal paths and output locations, and updating documentation.

A new `benchmark/` directory has been created for **Phase 3: Real Benchmarking**. This directory will contain scripts for directly benchmarking language model performance on ARC tasks.

Recently, work has focused on addressing an issue with the "best of" functionality in the real benchmarking script and verifying compatibility with related utilities.

## Recent changes

*   **Addressed "Best of" Issue in Benchmark Script:**
    *   Identified an issue in `benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py` where the `best_of` parameter was not correctly processing multiple generation attempts per task, effectively running as "best of 1".
    *   Modified the `process_single_task` function to loop `best_of` times, generating and verifying each attempt.
    *   Ensured results for all attempts for a given task are stored within a single entry in the output file, with relevant fields (prompt_messages, reasoning, python_code, etc.) stored as lists.
*   **Verified Compatibility of Synthetic Data Scripts:**
    *   Confirmed that `synthetic_data_generators/generate_code_data.py` and `synthetic_data_generators/generate_reasoning_data.py` do not have the "best of" functionality and are not affected by the issue found in the benchmark script.
*   **Verified Compatibility of Merge Reasoning Script:**
    *   Confirmed that `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py` is already compatible with the new list-based approach for storing reasoning in the benchmark results, as it includes logic to handle reasoning as either a string or a list of strings.
*   **Enhanced Benchmark and Synthetic Data Generation (Previous):**
    *   **Standardized JSON Structure:**
        *   Modified all scripts to use a single file for storing results
        *   Each script now appends new entries to a single JSONL file
        *   Metadata is added to the same file at the end of each run
        *   Future runs will continue to append to this file, preserving all previous results
    *   **Added Best-of Flag to Benchmark Script (Initial Implementation):**
        *   New `--best_of` command-line argument to specify the number of responses to generate
        *   All responses are stored as lists, even when best_of is 1, ensuring consistent data structure
        *   Provides the foundation for generating multiple answers with different parameters
    *   **Updated Merge Reasoning Script (Initial Update):**
        *   Modified `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py` to handle both list-based and string-based reasoning formats
        *   Added support for JSONL files (detecting by file extension)
        *   Restructured the code for better readability and maintainability
*   **Completed Refactoring of Synthetic Data Generation Structure (Previous):**
    *   Renamed the main `benchmark/` directory to `synthetic_data_generators/`.
    *   Renamed the results subdirectory `benchmark/benchmark_results/` to `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/`.
    *   Renamed data generation scripts:
        *   `generate_reasoning_benchmark_data.py` -> `generate_reasoning_data.py`
        *   `generate_code_benchmark_data.py` -> `generate_code_data.py`
    *   Updated the default `output_directory` in `utilities/config.py` to `../synthetic_data` (relative to `utilities/`).
    *   Updated log file paths in both data generation scripts to save within `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/`.
    *   Updated output paths in both data generation scripts to save results into subdirectories (`reasoning_data/` and `code_data/`) within `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/` using the new naming convention (e.g., `reasoning_data_results_*.json`).
    *   Updated help text in `synthetic_data_generators/verify_generated_code.py` to reflect the new results path structure.
    *   Updated import paths across all affected scripts (`synthetic_data_generators/*`, `agents/*`, `utilities/*`, `auxiliary_utilities/*`).
    *   Updated documentation (`readme.md`, `memory_bank/techContext.md`, `memory_bank/systemPatterns.md`, `memory_bank/activeContext.md`) to reflect the new structure, names, and paths.
*   **Created New Benchmark Directory (Previous):**
    *   A new `benchmark/` directory has been created for real benchmarking efforts (Phase 3).
    *   This directory currently contains a single file (`benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py`) that handles both generating model responses and evaluating them.
*   **Previous Work (Pre-Refactor):**
    *   Established core components for data generation (agents, utilities, scripts).
    *   Implemented features like concurrency, periodic saving, graceful exit, dataset.json loading, CLI arguments, enhanced logging, and refined JSON output.
    *   Successfully ran reasoning and code data generation scripts.
    *   Merged reasoning results into `data/traces_store.json`.
    *   Created and refined the code verification script.

## Next steps

*   **Phase 2 (Synthetic Data Generation & Verification):**
    *   **Run Code Verification Script:** Execute `synthetic_data_generators/verify_generated_code.py` on the results from the code generation run (e.g., `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`) to assess the correctness of the generated code. **(Next immediate step for Phase 2)**.
    *   **Analyze Verification Results:** Review the output and logs (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_verification.log`) from the verification script.
    *   **Analyze Reasoning Data:** Review the merged reasoning data in `data/traces_store.json` (from the reasoning data generation run).
    *   **Analyze Code Generation Results (Qualitative):** Review the raw output JSON (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`) for qualitative insights into reasoning and code structure, especially for tasks that failed verification.
    *   **Update `.gitignore`:** Add `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/` to `.gitignore`.
    *   **Consider Further Data Generation:** Decide if additional data generation runs are needed.
    *   **Refine Agents/Prompting:** Based on verification results and qualitative analysis, consider refinements.
*   **Phase 3 (Real Benchmarking):**
    *   Run the code benchmarking script `benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py` with the corrected "best of" functionality to evaluate model performance on ARC tasks.
    *   Run the new direct answer benchmarking script `benchmark/run_direct_benchmark.py` to evaluate model performance on directly generating answers without code.
    *   Test the best-of flag with both benchmark scripts to generate multiple responses for each task.
    *   Compare the results between the code-based and direct answer approaches.
    *   Analyze the benchmark results, which include information about whether the generated code/answers were successful.
    *   Consider refinements to the benchmarking process based on initial results.

## Active decisions and considerations

*   Model selection and parameters are centralized in `utilities/config.py`.
*   Error handling for model API calls and file I/O is implemented.
*   The data generation currently focuses on generating reasoning/code for 'train' examples only.
*   **Data Loading:**
    *   The data generation scripts (`generate_reasoning_data.py`, `generate_code_data.py`) load tasks *iteratively* from `data/dataset.json` by default.
    *   The generated results files embed the necessary `task_data` (including test cases) within each result entry.
    *   The real benchmarking scripts (`benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py` and `benchmark/run_direct_benchmark.py`) also load tasks iteratively from `data/dataset.json`.
*   **Code Verification (Phase 2):**
    *   The `verify_generated_code.py` script reads a code data results file (e.g., `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_*.json`) and uses the `task_data` embedded within it for verification. It no longer requires a separate `dataset.json` input.
*   Configuration is now handled via a combination of `utilities/config.py` defaults and command-line argument overrides.
*   JSON output includes detailed metadata and the full prompt structure.
*   **Concurrency control:** `asyncio.Semaphore` is used in both data generation scripts to limit the number of tasks processed simultaneously, controlled by `max_concurrent_tasks` in the configuration (defaulting to 5, overrideable via CLI). The real benchmarking scripts (`benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py` and `benchmark/run_direct_benchmark.py`) also use `asyncio.Semaphore` for concurrency control.
*   **Result Saving:**
    *   **Synthetic Data Generation Scripts:**
        *   Results are accumulated in a global list (`g_results`).
        *   **Partial results:** New results are appended periodically (every `SAVE_INTERVAL` successful tasks) to fixed files (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data/reasoning_data_partial_results.jsonl` or `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_partial_results.jsonl`) in JSON Lines format. Global counters (`g_last_saved_results_len`) prevent duplicate entries.
        *   **Final results:** All accumulated results (`g_results`) are saved upon normal exit (`atexit`) or interruption (`SIGINT`) to timestamped `.json` files (with distinct prefixes/paths: `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/reasoning_data/reasoning_data_results_*.json` or `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_*.json`, and `_interrupted` suffix if applicable), containing metadata and the full list of results.
        *   A simple file lock (`g_is_saving`) prevents concurrent save attempts during both periodic and final saves.
        *   **Crucially, the timestamp for the results file is generated once at the beginning of the script execution and stored in a global variable (`g_timestamp`). This prevents concurrent tasks from generating different timestamps and overwriting each other's results.**
    *   **Real Benchmarking Scripts:**
        *   Use a similar approach to the synthetic data generation scripts.
        *   Results are accumulated in a global list (`g_results`).
        *   **Partial results:** New results are appended periodically to `benchmark/benchmark_results/code_benchmark/code_benchmark_partial_results.jsonl` or `benchmark/benchmark_results/direct_benchmark/direct_benchmark_partial_results.jsonl`.
        *   **Final results:** All accumulated results are saved to JSONL files in their respective directories.
        *   Include detailed metadata about the benchmark runs, including verification/accuracy statistics.
        *   **Similar to the synthetic data generators, the timestamp for the results file is generated once at the beginning of the script execution and stored in a global variable (`g_timestamp`) to ensure all concurrent tasks write to the same file.**
*   **Data Structure Consistency:**
    *   All responses (prompt_messages, reasoning, python_code, output_grid, etc.) are now stored as lists, even when best_of is 1.
    *   This ensures consistent data structure across all scripts and makes it easier to process the results programmatically.
    *   The `merge_reasoning.py` script has been updated to handle both list-based and string-based reasoning formats for backward compatibility.
*   **Agent Prompting:**
    *   The `ReasoningTraceGenerator` agent uses a system prompt that includes guidance on the number-to-color mapping.
    *   The `ReasoningCodeGenerator` agent uses a different prompt structure designed to elicit both reasoning and Python code.
    *   The `CodeGeneratingAgent` in the code benchmarking script generates both reasoning and Python code, which is then verified against the task's test cases.
    *   The `DirectAnswerAgent` in the direct answer benchmarking script generates reasoning and a direct output grid answer, which is compared directly with the expected output.
