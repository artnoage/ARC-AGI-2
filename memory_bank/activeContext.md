# Active Context

## Current work focus

The current focus is on completing and testing the synthetic data generation and verification components, followed by comprehensive benchmarking of language models on ARC tasks.

## Recent changes

**Synthetic Data Creation Interfaces**
* Implemented username authentication and interface initialization
* Fixed WebSocket connection issues (using default `/socket.io/` path)
* Fixed logout redirection to the root URL (`/`)
* Improved discussion interface layout and space allocation:
  * Added "Go to Task #" functionality to the Discussion Interface
  * Moved all navigation controls to a dedicated "Navigation" panel in the bottom section
  * Removed duplicate navigation controls from the top section to give more space for task display
  * Repositioned execution buttons for better space utilization
  * Added task name display in the header that updates when task changes
  * Fixed horizontal scrolling in code execution panel to preserve header position
  * Redesigned settings panel to be more compact (70% height reduction)
  * Restructured settings panel into three vertical columns ("API Settings", "Navigation", and "Execution Controls") with visual separators for improved layout
  * Made sliders shorter to fit better in the compact panels
* Enhanced OpenRouter API integration:
  * Added model selector dropdown
  * Implemented temperature slider for controlling AI responses
  * Ensured full conversation history is sent to the AI model
* Implemented chat memory in discussion interface:
  * Username-based and task-specific memory storage
  * Persistent conversations across page refreshes
  * Automatic pruning of oldest conversations if localStorage is full
* Enhanced Python code execution environment:
  * Added visual representation for input/output grids
  * Implemented "Visualize Input/Output" buttons
  * Improved layout and spacing of execution controls
  * Added guidance on handling common errors

**Synthetic Data Generation & Verification**
* Enhanced data generation scripts with:
  * Concurrency control using `asyncio.Semaphore`
  * Periodic saving to JSONL files
  * Graceful exit handling with final result saving
  * Task filtering via `--task_ids` command-line argument
* Successfully ran reasoning trace generation with GEMINI_FLASH model
* Successfully ran code generation with GEMINI_FLASH model
* Implemented code verification script to test generated solutions

**LLM Benchmarking**
* Created two benchmark scripts:
  * `run_code_benchmark.py` for code-based evaluation
  * `run_direct_benchmark.py` for direct answer evaluation
* Added "best-of" functionality to generate multiple solutions per task
* Fixed issues with multiple attempt processing
* Added solved/unsolved task IDs to benchmark metadata
* Implemented task filtering via `--task_ids` command-line argument

## Next steps

**Synthetic Data Generation & Verification**
* Run code verification script on generated solutions
* Analyze verification results and code quality
* Consider additional data generation runs with different models
* Update `.gitignore` to exclude synthetic data directory

**LLM Benchmarking**
* Run comprehensive benchmarks with multiple models
* Compare code-based vs. direct answer approaches
* Analyze performance patterns across different task types

**Synthetic Data Creation Interfaces**
* Consider additional enhancements (markdown rendering, etc.)
* Conduct final testing of complete workflow
* Update documentation

## Active decisions and considerations

**Interface Architecture**
* Three distinct interfaces with separate HTML, CSS, and JS files
* Centralized username input on welcome page, stored in cookie
* OpenRouter API key and settings stored in localStorage

**Deployment Considerations**
* All routes use `/arc2/` prefix for deployment compatibility
* WebSocket connections use default `/socket.io/` path, relying on reverse proxy configuration

**Data Management**
* Dataset loaded from `/arc2/static/dataset.json`
* Task data stored in memory
* Synthetic data stored in structured JSON format
* Results saved with timestamps to prevent overwriting

**AI Integration**
* Discussion interface integrated with OpenRouter API
* Temperature control via slider
* Full conversation history sent for better context
* Code execution environment for testing solutions

**Concurrency and Robustness**
* Async operations with concurrency limits
* Periodic saving of partial results
* Graceful shutdown with result preservation
