# Active Context

## Current work focus

The project is currently in **Phase 2: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning**. Following the completion of the synthetic data generation interface (Phase 1), the focus is now on implementing, testing, and refining the benchmarking suite to evaluate language model reasoning on ARC tasks.

## Recent changes (Phase 2)

*   Established the `benchmark/` directory structure.
*   Implemented core benchmarking components:
    *   `config.py`: Handles configuration (models, parameters, paths).
    *   `data_loader.py`: Loads individual ARC task files.
    *   `model_utils.py`: Manages model instantiation and API interactions (local/OpenRouter) with retries.
    *   `simple_agent.py`: Contains the agent logic for prompting the model with task examples.
    *   `run_benchmark.py`: Orchestrates the benchmark execution (async).
*   Refined benchmark components:
    *   Added command-line argument parsing (`argparse`) to `run_benchmark.py` for dynamic configuration (`--model_identifier`, `--max_tasks`).
    *   Enhanced logging (DEBUG level, file output to `benchmark_debug.log`) across benchmark scripts.
    *   Improved JSON output format to include metadata (model username, timestamp, etc.) and the full prompt messages sent to the model.
*   Refined auxiliary script `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py` to merge benchmark reasoning into `data/traces_store.json`, ensuring reasoning is stored in the `text` field and new entries are created for each merged reasoning trace for an existing task ID.
    *   Updated Memory Bank files to reflect project history and current phase.
    *   Updated `readme.md` to include documentation for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 (including benchmark usage).
    *   **Added support for loading tasks from a single `dataset.json` file:**
        *   Added `use_dataset_json` flag to `benchmark/config.py`.
        *   Added `--use_dataset_json` command-line argument to `benchmark/run_benchmark.py`.
        *   Implemented `load_tasks_from_dataset` function in `benchmark/data_loader.py`.
        *   Updated `run_benchmark.py` to use the appropriate data loading function based on the flag.
    *   **Implemented concurrency control:**
        *   Added `max_concurrent_tasks` field to `benchmark/config.py`.
        *   Added `--max_concurrent_tasks` command-line argument to `benchmark/run_benchmark.py`.
        *   Used `asyncio.Semaphore` in `run_benchmark.py` to limit concurrent task processing.
        *   **Fixed large dataset loading:** Modified `run_benchmark.py` to iterate over the `load_tasks_from_dataset` generator directly when `use_dataset_json` is true, avoiding loading the entire dataset into memory. (Done)

## Next steps (Phase 2)

*   **Execute Benchmark:** Manually run the benchmark to test both loading methods and verify the concurrency implementation:
    *   **Individual Files:** `python benchmark/run_benchmark.py --model_identifier <MODEL> --max_tasks <N> --max_concurrent_tasks <C>`
    *   **Dataset File:** `python benchmark/run_benchmark.py --model_identifier <MODEL> --max_tasks <N> --use_dataset_json --task_directory ../data --max_concurrent_tasks <C>` (Replace `<MODEL>`, `<N>`, `<C>` with appropriate values).
*   **Analyze Logs:** Check `benchmark_debug.log` for correct concurrent execution, semaphore usage, potential errors, and overall flow.
*   **Merge Results:** Use `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py` to integrate the benchmark output into `data/traces_store.json`.
*   **Analyze Data:** Review the merged reasoning data in `traces_store.json`.
*   **Update Memory Bank:** Update `progress.md` and `systemPatterns.md` to reflect the completed concurrency and dataset loading implementation.

## Active decisions and considerations (Phase 2)

*   Model selection and parameters are centralized in `benchmark/config.py`.
*   Error handling for model API calls and file I/O is implemented.
*   The benchmark currently focuses on generating reasoning for 'train' examples only.
*   **Data loading now supports two methods:**
    *   Loading individual task files from a directory (default).
    *   Loading tasks *iteratively* from a single `dataset.json` file (using `--use_dataset_json` flag). This avoids loading the entire dataset into memory at once.
*   Benchmark configuration is now handled via a combination of `config.py` defaults and command-line argument overrides.
*   JSON output includes detailed metadata and the full prompt structure.
*   **Concurrency control:** `asyncio.Semaphore` is used in `run_benchmark.py` to limit the number of tasks processed simultaneously, controlled by `max_concurrent_tasks` in the configuration (defaulting to 5, overrideable via CLI).
