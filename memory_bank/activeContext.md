# Active Context
## Current work focus

The project is currently focused on enhancing the user interface to provide two distinct interaction modes: task solving and AI discussion. This involves creating a central welcome page and modifying the existing and new interface pages to integrate with this new flow and ensure correct data loading based on the dataset structure. We have recently completed implementing username authentication, updating task ID references, fixing issues related to WebSocket connections and logout redirection, and integrating OpenRouter API functionality into the discussion interface.

## Recent changes

*   **Implemented Username Authentication and Interface Initialization:**
    *   Removed the internal welcome screen logic from `apps/static/js/testing_interface.js` and `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js`.
    *   Added username cookie check and redirect logic at the beginning of the `$(document).ready()` function in both `apps/static/js/testing_interface.js` and `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js`.
    *   Ensured the main content of both interfaces is visible by default.
*   **Updated Task ID Property:**
    *   Changed all references from `.id` to `.task_id` when accessing task identifiers in `apps/static/js/testing_interface.js` and `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js`.
    *   Updated related warning messages to reference 'task_id' field.
*   **Fixed WebSocket Connection Issues:**
    *   Modified the WebSocket connection logic in `apps/static/js/testing_interface.js` and `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js` to use the default `/socket.io/` path.
    *   Improved graceful handling of disconnected WebSocket in `apps/static/js/testing_interface.js`.
*   **Fixed Logout Redirection:**
    *   Updated the logout function in `apps/static/js/testing_interface.js` and `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js` to redirect to the root URL (`/`).
*   **Created New Discuss Interface (Previous):**
    *   Created `apps/discuss_interface.html`, `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js`, and `apps/static/css/discuss_interface.css`.
    *   Implemented task demonstration area and chat interface.
    *   Added API key input for OpenRouter integration.
    *   Implemented simulated AI responses.
*   **Updated Main Interface (Previous):**
    *   Modified `data/index.html` to serve as the central welcome page with username input and navigation buttons.
    *   Added JavaScript logic to `data/index.html` to handle username input, set a cookie, and navigate.
    *   Added jQuery library to `data/index.html`.
    *   Updated styling for the welcome page.
*   **Updated Task Interfaces (HTML) (Previous):**
    *   Removed the internal welcome screen and username prompts from `apps/testing_interface.html` and `apps/discuss_interface.html`.
    *   Ensured the main content of both interfaces is visible by default.
    *   Updated CSS and JavaScript links in both files to use the `/arc2/static/` prefix.
*   **Fixed Navigation and Routing (Previous):**
    *   Ensured all links use the correct `/arc2/` prefix for deployment compatibility.
    *   Added a new route in `server.py` (`@app.route('/arc2/apps/<path:filename>')`) to serve files from the `apps` directory with the `/arc2/apps/` prefix.
    *   Corrected the root route (`@app.route('/')`) in `server.py` to serve `data/index.html`.
*   **Enhanced Benchmark and Synthetic Data Generation (Previous):**
    *   **Standardized JSON Structure:** Modified all scripts to use a single JSONL file for results.
    *   **Added Best-of Flag to Benchmark Script (Initial Implementation):** Added `--best_of` argument and stored responses as lists.
    *   **Updated Merge Reasoning Script (Initial Update):** Modified `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py` to handle list-based reasoning and JSONL.
*   **Completed Refactoring of Synthetic Data Generation Structure (Previous):** Renamed directories and scripts, updated paths and documentation.
*   **Created New Benchmark Directory (Previous):** Created a new `benchmark/` directory for real benchmarking.
*   **Previous Work (Pre-Refactor):** Established core components, implemented features like concurrency, saving, logging, and refined JSON output.
*   **Fixed Delayed Argument Parsing Error (Previous):** Removed duplicate argument parsing blocks.
*   **Added Solved/Unsolved Task IDs to Benchmark Metadata (Previous):** Included lists of solved and unsolved task IDs in benchmark metadata.
*   **Integrated OpenRouter API into Discussion Interface:**
    *   Created `apps/static/js/openrouter_api.js` to handle communication with the OpenRouter API.
    *   Added a model selector dropdown to `apps/discuss_interface.html`.
    *   Updated `apps/static/css/discuss_interface.css` to style the new model selector.
    *   Modified `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js` to use the `openrouter_api.js` functions for sending messages and to handle the API key check before sending.
    *   Fixed duplicate `SELECTED_MODEL` variable declaration in `apps/static/js/discuss_interface.js`.

## Next steps

*   **Phase 2 (Synthetic Data Generation & Verification):**
    *   **Run Code Verification Script:** Execute `synthetic_data_generators/verify_generated_code.py` on the results from the code generation run (e.g., `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`) to assess the correctness of the generated code. (Next immediate step for Phase 2).
    *   **Analyze Verification Results:** Review the output and logs (`synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_verification.log`) from the verification script.
    *   **Analyze Reasoning Data:** Evaluate the quality of the `GEMINI_FLASH` reasoning from the reasoning data generation run (merged into `data/traces_store.json`).
    *   **Analyze Code Generation Results (Qualitative):** After verification, perform a qualitative review of the reasoning and code in `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/code_data/code_data_results_20250504_165606.json`, especially for failed tasks.
    *   **Update `.gitignore`:** Add `synthetic_data_generators/synthetic_data/` to `.gitignore`.
    *   **Consider Further Data Generation:** Decide if additional data generation runs are needed.
    *   **Refine Agents/Prompting:** Based on verification results and qualitative analysis, consider refinements.
*   **Phase 3 (Real Benchmarking):**
    *   **Run Code Benchmarking Script:** Execute `benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py` with appropriate parameters (e.g., `python benchmark/run_code_benchmark.py --model_identifier GEMINI_FLASH --max_tasks 10 --max_concurrent_tasks 3 --best_of 3`) to evaluate model performance on ARC tasks, now with the corrected "best of" functionality.
    *   **Run Direct Answer Benchmarking Script:** Execute `benchmark/run_direct_benchmark.py` with similar parameters to evaluate model performance on directly generating answers without code.
    *   Test the best-of flag with both benchmark scripts to generate multiple responses for each task.
    *   Compare the results between the code-based and direct answer approaches.
    *   Analyze the benchmark results, which include information about whether the generated code/answers were successful.
    *   Consider refinements to the benchmarking process based on initial results.
*   **Phase 1 (Synthetic Data Generation Interface):**
    *   **Enhance Discussion Interface:** Add features like chat history, markdown rendering, etc.
    *   **Testing and Refinement:** Test the complete workflow and interfaces.
    *   **Documentation:** Update project documentation.

## Active decisions and considerations

*   **Interface Separation:** Three distinct interfaces with separate HTML, CSS, and JS files.
*   **Dataset Loading:** Unified dataset loaded from `/arc2/static/dataset.json`. Task data stored in memory.
*   **Navigation Structure:** Uses `/arc2/` prefix for deployment compatibility. Server routes updated to handle this.
*   **User Experience:** Centralized username input on the welcome page, stored in a cookie. Interfaces redirect to the root URL (`/`) if no username is found. OpenRouter API key stored locally.
*   **AI Integration (Implemented):** Discussion interface is now integrated with the OpenRouter API for sending messages and receiving responses.
*   **Task Demonstration:** Consistent visual format for task display.
*   **Responsive Design:** Interfaces are designed to be responsive.
*   **File Modification Issues:** Encountered difficulties with automated JavaScript file modifications, requiring manual intervention for critical changes.
*   **Task ID Property:** Confirmed that the task identifier property in `apps/static/dataset.json` is `task_id`, not `id`. This has been corrected in the JavaScript files.
*   **WebSocket and Deployment:** The client-side now uses the default `/socket.io/` path for WebSocket connections, relying on reverse proxy configuration to handle the `/arc2/` prefix in deployment.
