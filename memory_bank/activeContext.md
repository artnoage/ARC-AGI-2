# Active Context

## Current work focus

The project is currently in **Phase 2: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning**. Following the completion of the synthetic data generation interface (Phase 1), the focus is now on implementing, testing, and refining the benchmarking suite to evaluate language model reasoning on ARC tasks.

## Recent changes (Phase 2)

*   Established the `benchmark/` directory structure.
*   Implemented core benchmarking components:
    *   `config.py`: Handles configuration (models, parameters, paths).
    *   `data_loader.py`: Loads individual ARC task files.
    *   `model_utils.py`: Manages model instantiation and API interactions (local/OpenRouter) with retries.
    *   `simple_agent.py`: Contains the agent logic for prompting the model with task examples.
    *   `run_benchmark.py`: Orchestrates the benchmark execution (async).
*   Refined benchmark components:
    *   Added command-line argument parsing (`argparse`) to `run_benchmark.py` for dynamic configuration (`--model_identifier`, `--max_tasks`).
    *   Enhanced logging (DEBUG level, file output to `benchmark_debug.log`) across benchmark scripts.
    *   Improved JSON output format to include metadata (model username, timestamp, etc.) and the full prompt messages sent to the model.
*   Refined auxiliary script `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py` to merge benchmark reasoning into `data/traces_store.json`, ensuring reasoning is stored in the `text` field and new entries are created for each merged reasoning trace for an existing task ID.
*   Updated Memory Bank files to reflect project history and current phase.
*   Updated `readme.md` to include documentation for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 (including benchmark usage).

## Next steps (Phase 2)

*   Manually execute the benchmark (`python benchmark/run_benchmark.py --model_identifier <MODEL> --max_tasks <N>`) with desired models and task limits.
*   Analyze the detailed logs in `benchmark_debug.log` to diagnose any connection or execution issues.
*   Use the new `auxiliary_utilities/merge_reasoning.py` script to merge the generated reasoning from the benchmark results file into `data/traces_store.json`.
*   Analyze the merged reasoning data.

## Active decisions and considerations (Phase 2)

*   Model selection and parameters are centralized in `benchmark/config.py`.
*   Error handling for model API calls and file I/O is implemented.
*   The benchmark currently focuses on generating reasoning for 'train' examples only.
*   Data loading uses individual task files from the directory specified in `config.py` to avoid memory issues with large datasets.
*   Benchmark configuration is now handled via a combination of `config.py` defaults and command-line argument overrides.
*   JSON output includes detailed metadata and the full prompt structure.
