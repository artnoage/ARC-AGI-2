# Active Context

## Current work focus

The project is currently in **Phase 2: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning**. Following the completion of the synthetic data generation interface (Phase 1), the focus is now on implementing, testing, and refining the benchmarking suite to evaluate language model reasoning on ARC tasks.

## Recent changes (Phase 2)

*   Established the `benchmark/` directory structure.
*   Implemented core benchmarking components:
    *   `config.py`: Handles configuration (models, parameters, paths).
    *   `data_loader.py`: Loads individual ARC task files.
    *   `model_utils.py`: Manages model instantiation and API interactions (local/OpenRouter) with retries.
    *   `simple_agent.py`: Contains the agent logic for prompting the model with task examples.
    *   `run_benchmark.py`: Orchestrates the benchmark execution (async).
*   Updated Memory Bank files to reflect project history and current phase.
*   Updated `readme.md` to include documentation for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 (including benchmark usage).

## Next steps (Phase 2)

*   Thoroughly test the benchmark execution (`python benchmark/run_benchmark.py`) with various configured models (local server and/or OpenRouter API key in `.env`).
*   Analyze the reasoning output saved in `data/evaluation/`.
*   Refine the result format, logging, or agent prompting based on initial test results.
*   Consider adding command-line arguments for dynamic configuration (e.g., selecting specific tasks or models).

## Active decisions and considerations (Phase 2)

*   Model selection and parameters are centralized in `benchmark/config.py`.
*   Error handling for model API calls and file I/O is implemented.
*   The benchmark currently focuses on generating reasoning for 'train' examples only.
*   Data loading uses individual task files from the directory specified in `config.py` to avoid memory issues with large datasets.
