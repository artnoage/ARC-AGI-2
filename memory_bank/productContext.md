*   **Real Benchmarking:** A dedicated benchmarking script within the `benchmark/` directory will handle loading ARC tasks, prompting models for solutions, executing generated code (if applicable), and evaluating the results. This script will be configurable and save detailed output for analysis. The saving mechanism has been made robust to ensure all results are captured even during concurrent execution. Users can now specify a list of task IDs to process using the `--task_ids` command-line argument.

## User experience goals

*   **Synthetic Data Generation Interface:** An intuitive interface for task interaction, transformation, and reasoning annotation. Clear feedback mechanisms (like the distance metric).
*   **Discussion Interface:** A dedicated interface for discussing ARC tasks with an AI assistant.
    *   Improved layout for better visibility of examples and chat area.
    *   Automatic population of the input grid with the first test input for easier testing.
    *   Clear and organized view of the conversation history with preserved code indentation in AI responses.
    *   Allows users to control AI behavior via parameters like temperature.
    *   Enables testing Python code solutions directly within the interface, with guidance on common issues like the 'shape' attribute error.
    *   Ensures the AI assistant has full conversation context by including chat history in API calls.
*   **Synthetic Data Generation Scripts:** Easy configuration and execution of data generation and verification processes. Detailed logging for troubleshooting. Clear, structured output for analysis, with a robust saving mechanism that correctly handles concurrent task execution. Users can now specify a list of task IDs to process using the `--task_ids` command-line argument.
