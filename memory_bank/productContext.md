*   **Real Benchmarking:** A dedicated benchmarking script within the `benchmark/` directory will handle loading ARC tasks, prompting models for solutions, executing generated code (if applicable), and evaluating the results. This script will be configurable and save detailed output for analysis. The saving mechanism has been made robust to ensure all results are captured even during concurrent execution. Users can now specify a list of task IDs to process using the `--task_ids` command-line argument.

## User experience goals

*   **Synthetic Data Generation Interface:** An intuitive interface for task interaction, transformation, and reasoning annotation. Clear feedback mechanisms (like the distance metric).
*   **Discussion Interface:** A dedicated interface for discussing ARC tasks with an AI assistant. Allows users to control AI behavior via parameters like temperature and test Python code solutions directly within the interface. Provides a clear and organized view of the conversation history and code execution results.
*   **Synthetic Data Generation Scripts:** Easy configuration and execution of data generation and verification processes. Detailed logging for troubleshooting. Clear, structured output for analysis, with a robust saving mechanism that correctly handles concurrent task execution. Users can now specify a list of task IDs to process using the `--task_ids` command-line argument.
*   **Real Benchmarking:** Easy configuration and execution of benchmarks. Clear, structured output for analysis of model performance, with a robust saving mechanism that correctly handles concurrent task execution. Users can now specify a list of task IDs to process using the `--task_ids` command-line argument.
