# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

*   [Provide a high-level description of the system architecture (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Client-Server).]
*   [Include diagrams (e.g., Mermaid) if helpful to visualize the structure.]
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Client] --> B(API Gateway);
        B --> C{Service 1};
        B --> D{Service 2};
        C --> E[Database];
        D --> E;
    ```

## Key Technical Decisions

*   [Document significant architectural or technical choices made.]
*   [Explain the reasoning behind these decisions and any trade-offs considered.]

## Design Patterns

*   [List the major design patterns employed in the codebase (e.g., MVC, Observer, Singleton).]
*   [Provide brief examples or locations where these patterns are used.]

## Component Relationships

*   [Describe how major components or modules interact with each other.]
*   [Detail dependencies between components.]
