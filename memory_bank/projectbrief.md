# Project Brief

## Core Requirements & Goals

*   Create a simple agent for benchmarking purposes.
*   The agent should use a system prompt to inform the model it's an IQ test.
*   The agent should feed the 'train' entries from ARC dataset tasks to the model.
*   The model should explain its reasoning for solving the task based on the training examples.
*   This agent will be the first step towards creating benchmarks for a new project.

## Scope

*   Initial agent implementation with system prompt and data feeding logic for training examples.
*   Creation of initial memory bank documentation.

## Stakeholders

*   User (requestor)
*   Cline (AI Assistant)

## Timeline & Milestones (Optional)

*   Complete initial agent implementation and memory bank setup.
