      "text": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning process based on the provided examples.\n\n1.  **Observe Grid Dimensions:** The input grids are always 3x3, and the output grids are always 9x9. This 3x increase in both dimensions suggests that each cell in the input grid corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output grid.\n\n2.  **Analyze Block Content:** Let's examine how the output grid's 3x3 blocks relate to the input grid's cells. We can divide the 9x9 output grid into nine 3x3 blocks.\n    *   Consider Example 1:\n        *   Input `[0,0]` is 6 (non-zero). The top-left 3x3 block of the output `(rows 0-2, cols 0-2)` is `[[6, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6]]`, which is identical to the *entire* input grid.\n        *   Input `[0,2]` is 0. The top-right 3x3 block of the output `(rows 0-2, cols 6-8)` is `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`, which is a block filled with zeros.\n        *   Input `[1,1]` is 0. The central 3x3 block of the output `(rows 3-5, cols 3-5)` is `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`, also a block of zeros.\n        *   Input `[2,1]` is 6 (non-zero). The bottom-middle 3x3 block of the output `(rows 6-8, cols 3-5)` is `[[6, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6]]`, again identical to the *entire* input grid.\n\n3.  **Identify the Pattern:** This pattern holds across all examples. The transformation rule appears to be:\n    *   Create an empty 9x9 output grid, initially filled with zeros.\n    *   Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the 3x3 input grid.\n    *   If the value `Input[r, c]` is *not* zero:\n        *   Copy the *entire* original 3x3 input grid into the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid. This block is located at rows `3*r` to `3*r + 2` and columns `3*c` to `3*c + 2`.\n    *   If the value `Input[r, c]` *is* zero:\n        *   The corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid remains filled with zeros (or is explicitly filled with zeros).\n\n4.  **Summarize the Reasoning:** The output 9x9 grid is constructed by tiling 3x3 blocks. The content of each 3x3 block in the output is determined by the value of the corresponding cell in the 3x3 input grid. If the input cell's value is non-zero, the corresponding output block is a complete copy of the original input grid. If the input cell's value is zero, the corresponding output block is filled entirely with zeros. This is essentially using the input grid itself as a pattern to tile copies of itself onto a larger grid, gated by the non-zero values in the input.",

They disappear.\n    *   The '0' cells (background) remain '0'.\n\n3.  **Determine the Rule for the Replacement Digit:** Since the '8's are replaced by different digits in different examples (7, 3, 2), something must be determining *which* digit to use. The only other varying element in the input is the pattern/shape formed by the '1's.\n\n4.  **Hypothesize the Connection:** The specific configuration or shape formed by the '1' cells in the input grid dictates the digit that will replace the '8' cells in the output grid.\n    *   In Example 1, the specific '1's pattern corresponds to the output digit '7'.\n    *   In Examples 2 and 4, the '1's pattern (which is the same in both) corresponds to the output digit '3'.\n    *   In Examples 3 and 5, the '1's pattern (which is the same in both) corresponds to the output digit '2'.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Reasoning Process:**\n    a.

These are areas where you cannot reach the edge of the grid from a '0' cell without crossing a '2'.\n\n2.  **Preserve Boundaries:** The '2' cells that form the boundary of these enclosed regions remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Determine Fill Color Based on Boundary Shape:** The key step is realizing that the color used to fill the enclosed '0's depends on the specific shape or pattern of the '2' boundary enclosing it.\n    *   Observe Example 1 (Bottom-Left), Example 3 (Top-Left), and Example 4 (Top-Left). These all feature the *same* 5x5 boundary shape (a square frame with one internal '2' cell creating an indentation). The enclosed '0's in these cases are always filled with the color '8'.\n    *   Observe Example 2 (Top-Left) and Example 3 (Bottom-Right). These feature a *different*, but consistent, 7x7 boundary shape (again, a square frame with one internal '2' indentation). The enclosed '0's here are always filled with the color '4'.\n    *   Observe Example 1 (Top-Right). This features a unique, larger 9x9 boundary shape (also a frame with an internal '2' indentation). The enclosed '0's here are filled with the color '3'.\n\n4.  **Fill the Regions:** Once an enclosed region of '0's is identified and the corresponding fill color is determined based on its specific boundary shape ('8' for shape type 1, '4' for shape type 2, '3' for shape type 3), all the '0' cells within that region are changed to that fill color in the output grid.\n\n5.  **Leave Others Unchanged:** Any '0' cells that are *not* enclosed by a '2' boundary remain '0' in the output.\n\n**In summary:** The transformation identifies enclosed '0' regions bounded by '2's. It keeps the '2' boundaries intact but fills the enclosed '0's with a new color ('3', '4', or '8') determined uniquely by the specific shape of the enclosing '2' boundary.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning process based on the provided examples.\n\n1.  **Analyze Value Transformation:** Compare the numbers within the input and output grids.\n    *   In all examples, cells containing `0` in the input grid remain `0` in the output grid.\n    *   Cells containing `1` in the input grid become `2` in the output grid.\n    *   **Rule 1:** Apply a value mapping: `0 -> 0` and `1 -> 2` to every cell in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Analyze Grid Dimensions:** Observe the size change between input and output.\n    *   Example 1: Input is 6x3, Output is 9x3.\n    *   Example 2: Input is 6x3, Output is 9x3.\n    *   Example 3: Input is 6x3, Output is 9x3.\n    *   **Observation:** The number of columns remains constant (3). The number of rows increases from 6 to 9. This is an increase of 3 rows, which is exactly half the original number of rows.\n\n3.  **Analyze Row Structure:** Determine how the output rows are constructed from the input rows (after applying Rule 1). Let's call the input grid after applying Rule 1 the \"transformed input grid\".\n    *   The first 6 rows of the output grid are identical to the 6 rows of the transformed input grid.\n    *   The last 3 rows of the output grid (rows 7, 8, 9) need to be determined. Let's compare them to the first 3 rows of the transformed input grid:\n        *   Example 1: Transformed input rows 1-3 are `[[0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0]]`. Output rows 7-9 are `[[0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0]]`. They match.\n        *   Example 2: Transformed input rows 1-3 are `[[0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0]]`. Output rows 7-9 are `[[0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0]]`. They do *not* match exactly (row 8 is different). However, rows 7 and 9 match row 1, and row 8 matches row 4 of the transformed input.\n        *   Example 3: Transformed input rows 1-3 are `[[0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0]]`. Output rows 7-9 are `[[0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0]]`. They match.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Based on majority and simplicity):** The output grid is constructed by taking the entire transformed input grid (rows 1-6) and appending its first half (rows 1-3) to the end.\n\n**Reasoning Process Summary:**\n\nTo generate the output grid from a given input grid:\n1.  Create a new grid by replacing every `1` in the input grid with a `2`, keeping the `0`s as they are. Let's call this the \"transformed grid\".\n2.  The output grid will have the same number of columns as the input but will have 1.5 times the number of rows (9 rows for a 6-row input).\n3.  Construct the output grid by taking all the rows from the \"transformed grid\" and then appending a copy of the *first half* (the first 3 rows) of the \"transformed grid\" to the bottom.",

A 3x3 hollow square is a 3x3 area where the 8 border cells have the color, and the central cell remains 0 (background).\n\n2.  **Color Independence:** The transformation process is applied independently to each distinct non-zero color found in the input grid.\n\n3.  **Component Analysis:** For each color, identify its connected components in the input grid (cells of the same color adjacent horizontally or vertically).\n\n4.  **Center Calculation:** For each identified component, calculate its center of mass. This is typically the average row and average column index of all cells belonging to the component, rounded to the nearest integer coordinates (r_c, c_c).\n\n5.  **Rule Application (Based on Component Size):** The number and placement of the output hollow squares depend primarily on the *size* (number of cells) of the input component:\n\n    *   **Larger Components (Size >= 5 in examples):** If the component has 5 or more cells (like the cross of 1s in Ex1, the Z-shape of 5s in Ex3, or the hollow square of 8s in Ex2), typically only *one* 3x3 hollow square is generated in the output. This square is centered at the calculated center of mass (r_c, c_c) of the input component.\n\n    *   **Size 3 Components (Lines, L-shapes):** If the component has exactly 3 cells, *three* 3x3 hollow squares are generated in the output.\n        *   The placement depends on the orientation of the 3 cells:\n            *   **Vertical Line:** The squares are centered at (r_c, c_c + 1), (r_c, c_c + 5), and (r_c, c_c + 9). (Offset (0, 1), repeating horizontally with step 4). (See Ex2, Color 3).\n            *   **Horizontal Line:** The squares are centered at (r_c + 1, c_c), (r_c + 5, c_c), and (r_c + 9, c_c). (Offset (1, 0), repeating vertically with step 4). (See Ex2, Color 2).\n            *   **L-shape:** The squares are centered at (r_c + 1, c_c + 1), (r_c + 5, c_c + 5), and (r_c + 9, c_c + 9). (Offset (1, 1), repeating diagonally with step (4, 4)). (See Ex3, Color 1).\n        *   Note: The initial offset (+1 in row/col) relative to the calculated center (r_c, c_c) seems consistent for size 3 components.\n\n    *   **Size 1 Components (Single Cells):** This case appears the most complex or context-dependent based on the examples.\n        *   Sometimes, a single input cell generates *one* output square with a simple offset (e.g., Ex3 Color 6: input (r, c) -> output centered at (r, c+1)).\n        *   Other times, a single input cell generates *multiple* output squares with an offset and repetition (e.g., Ex1 Color 2: input (8, 9) -> outputs centered at (8, 8), (8, 4), (8, 0), suggesting an offset of (0, -1) and a step of (0, -4)).\n        *   The rules for size 1 might depend on the cell's specific coordinates (parity?) or its relation to other components, which isn't fully clarified by these examples alone. However, the output is still one or more 3x3 hollow squares.\n\n6.  **Output Construction:** Start with an empty grid. For each component analyzed, draw the determined 3x3 hollow square(s) onto the output grid using the component's color. If multiple squares overlap, the last one drawn determines the final color of the overlapping cells.\n\n**In Summary:** The logic involves identifying connected components of each color, calculating their centers, and then generating one or more 3x3 hollow squares based primarily on the component's size, with specific placement and repetition rules for different sizes (especially size 3), centered relative to the component's original center of mass. The rule for single-cell components shows variability.",

These act as boundaries or dividers. Example 1 has a vertical line of color 8, suggesting boundaries can be vertical too, but the primary pattern in Examples 2 & 3 involves horizontal dividers.\n3.  **Trigger Cells:** The presence of red cells (color 4) *above* the color 8 divider line seems to initiate the transformation in Examples 2 and 3.\n4.  **Filling Pattern (Examples 2 & 3):** When a red cell (4) exists above the color 8 line in a column, it triggers a vertical \"drip\" or fill effect downwards in that column.\n    *   The triggering red cell (4) itself changes to green (3).\n    *   The cells below the trigger cell, down to (but not including) the color 8 divider line, are filled with red (4).\n    *   The cells below the color 8 divider line, down to (but not including) the color 2 divider line, are filled with dark grey (8).\n    *   The cells below the color 2 divider line, down to the bottom of the grid, are filled with blue (2).\n5.  **Priority:** If multiple red cells (4) exist in the same column above the color 8 line, only the *uppermost* one acts as the trigger for that column.\n6.  **Overwriting:** This filling process overwrites any existing colors in the affected cells below the trigger cell, *except* for the divider lines themselves (the horizontal lines of 8s and 2s remain intact).\n7.  **No Trigger:** If a column does not contain any red cells (4) above the color 8 divider line, that column remains unchanged from the input grid (except potentially being part of the divider lines).\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\n\nTo generate the output grid from the input grid, apply the following logic:\n\n1.  **Initialize:** Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.\n2.  **Identify Dividers:** Locate the row index `r8` of the horizontal line of color 8 and the row index `r2` of the horizontal line of color 2. (If these specific horizontal lines don't exist, this particular logic might not apply, or a different boundary needs identifying, like in Example 1).\n3.  **Iterate Columns:** Process each column `c` independently from left to right.\n4.  **Find Trigger:** Within the current column `c`, search downwards from the top row (row 0) to row `r8 - 1`. Find the row index `r_trigger` of the *first* cell encountered that contains color 4 (red).\n5.  **Apply Fill (if trigger found):**\n    *   If a trigger cell was found at `(r_trigger, c)`:\n        *   Change the color of the trigger cell in the output grid: `output[r_trigger][c] = 3` (green).\n        *   Fill downwards with red: For each row `r` from `r_trigger + 1` to `r8 - 1`, set `output[r][c] = 4` (red).\n        *   Fill downwards with dark grey: For each row `r` from `r8 + 1` to `r2 - 1`, set `output[r][c] = 8` (dark grey).\n        *   Fill downwards with blue: For each row `r` from `r2 + 1` to the last row of the grid, set `output[r][c] = 2` (blue).\n6.  **No Change (if no trigger):** If no cell with color 4 was found in column `c` above row `r8`, the column in the output grid remains identical to the input grid column (as initialized in step 1).\n7.  **Final Output:** After processing all columns, the resulting output grid is the final transformation.",

For each segment (defined by a number `N`, a row `r`, a minimum column `c_min`, and a maximum column `c_max`), fill all cells in the output grid from `(r, c_min)` to `(r, c_max)` with the number `N`.

      "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation pattern.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1.  **Color Preservation/Change:** The grids contain three colors: 0 (black/background), 1 (red), and 2 (blue). In the output, the original red cells (1) always remain red (1). Some blue cells (2) and black cells (0) might change to red (1), but no cell changes to blue (2). Blue cells (2) that are not changed remain blue (2). Black cells (0) that are not changed remain black (0).\n2.  **Role of Red Cells (1):** The transformation seems entirely driven by the positions of the red cells (1) in the input grid.\n3.  **Line Formation:** The output grids show horizontal and/or vertical lines of red cells (1) that weren't present (or were incomplete) in the input.\n4.  **Connecting Red Cells:**\n    *   In Example 1, the two red cells are in the same column (column 6). The output fills the entire segment of that column between the two red cells (rows 0 to 9) with red.\n    *   In Example 2, there are red cells in row 8 (at columns 0 and 19) and in column 7 (at rows 0 and 19). The output fills the horizontal segment in row 8 between columns 0 and 19, *and* the vertical segment in column 7 between rows 0 and 19, with red.\n    *   In Example 3, there are red cells in row 2 (at columns 0 and 13) and in column 7 (at rows 0 and 12). The output fills the horizontal segment in row 2 between columns 0 and 13, *and* the vertical segment in column 7 between rows 0 and 12, with red.\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\n\nThe transformation rule appears to be based on connecting pairs of red cells (value 1) that lie in the same row or same column.\n\n1.  **Identify Red Cells:** First, locate all cells in the input grid that have the value 1.\n2.  **Process Rows:** For each row in the input grid:\n    *   Check if there are two or more red cells (value 1) in that row.\n    *   If yes, find the column index of the leftmost red cell (`min_col`) and the rightmost red cell (`max_col`) in that row.\n    *   In the output grid, set all cells in that row from `min_col` to `max_col` (inclusive) to the value 1.\n3.  **Process Columns:** For each column in the input grid:\n    *   Check if there are two or more red cells (value 1) in that column.\n    *   If yes, find the row index of the topmost red cell (`min_row`) and the bottommost red cell (`max_row`) in that column.\n    *   In the output grid, set all cells in that column from `min_row` to `max_row` (inclusive) to the value 1.\n4.  **Preserve Other Cells:** Any cell in the grid that is *not* part of a horizontal or vertical segment identified in steps 2 or 3 retains its original value from the input grid. Note that the original red cells (1) will automatically be included in these segments or preserved if they don't form a segment with another red cell.\n\n**In summary:** The process identifies rows and columns containing multiple red '1's. It then draws horizontal and vertical red lines connecting the outermost red '1's within those respective rows and columns. All cells covered by these lines become red '1' in the output, while all other cells retain their original input values.",

The original positions of non-zero numbers in the input often retain their value in the output.\n2.  **Filling the Zeros:** The zero cells in the input grid are replaced by non-zero values in the output grid (with a potential exception noted in Example 3, Output[0][2]=0, which might be an anomaly or indicate a more complex rule).\n3.  **Source of Values:** The values filling the output grid seem to originate from the non-zero values present in the input grid. The output grid often looks like regions or zones expanding outwards from the initial non-zero input cells.\n4.  **Distance Concept:** This expansion suggests a \"nearest source\" principle. For any given cell in the grid, its value in the output appears to be determined by the value of the \"closest\" non-zero cell in the input grid.\n5.  **Distance Metric:** The way the regions expand suggests the Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences in row and column coordinates: `|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`) is likely used to determine closeness.\n6.  **Tie-Breaking:** When an output cell is equidistant from two or more different non-zero input cells, a tie-breaking rule must be applied. Observing the examples reveals inconsistencies if we assume simple tie-breaking rules (like choosing the smallest value, or based on row/column order of the source). For instance, in Example 1, Output[0][0] is 2, but the closest input cells are Input[0][4]=6 and Input[4][0]=4 (both distance 4), while Input[3][3]=2 is further away (distance 6). This indicates either a complex/unusual tie-breaking rule or that the \"nearest source\" model needs refinement. However, the general pattern strongly points towards this nearest-source concept.\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely reasoning process to transform the input grid to the output grid is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Sources:** Locate all cells in the input grid that contain a non-zero value. These are the \"source\" cells.\n2.  **Calculate Distances:** For *each* cell (r, c) in the grid (which will correspond to a cell in the output grid):\n    *   Calculate the Manhattan distance from (r, c) to *every* source cell (r', c') identified in step 1.\n3.  **Find Nearest Source(s):** Determine the minimum Manhattan distance calculated in step 2 for the cell (r, c). Identify all source cells (r', c') that are at this minimum distance.\n4.  **Assign Value (Apply Tie-Breaking):**\n    *   If there is only one unique nearest source cell, assign its value (Input[r'][c']) to the output cell Output[r][c].\n    *   If there are multiple source cells at the same minimum distance (a tie), apply a specific tie-breaking rule to select *one* of these nearest source cells. The value of this selected source cell is assigned to the output cell Output[r][c]. (Note: The exact tie-breaking rule is not consistently clear across all provided examples, but the core logic relies on finding the nearest source).\n5.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 2-4 for every cell in the grid to generate the complete output grid.\n\nIn essence, the process creates a Voronoi diagram based on the non-zero input cells using the Manhattan distance metric, where each cell in the output grid takes the value of the input cell that \"owns\" that region.",

The propagation follows these rules:\n   - The original value remains in its position\n   - The value propagates diagonally until it reaches the edge of the grid or encounters another propagation\n   - Each diagonal position gets filled with the value from the source\n\n3. When propagations from different sources overlap, the value that takes precedence appears to be determined by proximity to the source. If equidistant from multiple sources, there seems to be a priority based on the position of the source (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n\n4. The propagation creates a diamond-like pattern around each non-zero value in the input, with the original value at the center.\n\nThis explains why we see diagonal patterns of the same numbers spreading out from each non-zero value in the input grid, and why certain values appear to \"win\" in areas where multiple propagations would overlap.

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning process based on the provided examples.\n\n1.  **Identify Grid Components:** Observe the input grid and identify the distinct numbers (colors) present. In all examples, there are primarily two numbers. One number seems to form lines or borders, while the other fills the areas between these lines.\n\n2.  **Distinguish Separator vs. Background:** Determine which number acts as the \"separator\". This number consistently forms complete horizontal rows and/or complete vertical columns made up solely of that number. The other number is the \"background\" or \"region\" color, filling the rectangular areas partitioned by the separator lines.\n    *   Example 1: '8' forms full rows (row 3, row 9) and a full column (col 4). '1' is the background color.\n    *   Example 2: '7' forms full rows (row 2, row 12) and full columns (col 1, col 10, col 13). '3' is the background color.\n    *   Example 3: '1' forms full rows (rows 2, 7, 16, 21, 23) and full columns (cols 6, 21, 23, 25). '3' is the background color.\n\n3.  **Count Separator Lines:** Count the number of complete horizontal lines formed by the separator color (let's call this `H`) and the number of complete vertical lines formed by the separator color (let's call this `V`).\n\n4.  **Determine Output Grid Dimensions:** The separator lines divide the input grid into a grid of regions. The number of rows in the output grid will be `H + 1`, and the number of columns will be `V + 1`.\n    *   Example 1: H=2 (rows 3, 9), V=1 (col 4). Output dimensions: (2+1) x (1+1) = 3x2. (Matches output)\n    *   Example 2: H=2 (rows 2, 12), V=3 (cols 1, 10, 13). Output dimensions: (2+1) x (3+1) = 3x4. (Note: The provided output is 2x4, which seems inconsistent with the pattern from Ex 1 and 3. Assuming the pattern holds, the output *should* be 3x4).\n    *   Example 3: H=5 (rows 2, 7, 16, 21, 23), V=4 (cols 6, 21, 23, 25). Output dimensions: (5+1) x (4+1) = 6x5. (Matches output)\n\n5.  **Generate Output Grid Content:** Create a new grid with the dimensions calculated in the previous step. Fill this entire output grid uniformly with the \"background\" color identified in step 2.\n    *   Example 1: Background color is '1'. Output is a 3x2 grid of '1's.\n    *   Example 2: Background color is '3'. Output should be a 3x4 grid of '3's (based on the derived rule).\n    *   Example 3: Background color is '3'. Output is a 6x5 grid of '3's.\n\n**In summary:** The transformation identifies horizontal and vertical lines of a specific \"separator\" color. These lines define a grid structure. The output grid's dimensions correspond to this structure (number of separator lines + 1), and the output grid is filled entirely with the non-separator (\"background\") color found in the regions of the input grid.",

In these examples, the objects have colors '2' and '5'.\n\n3.  **Analyze Transformations by Color:** Examine how objects of each color change from input to output across the examples.\n\n    *   **Color 2 Objects:**\n        *   In Example 1, the color 2 object translates 2 steps down (0 rows, +2 columns). Its shape is preserved.\n        *   In Example 2, the color 2 object translates 2 steps right (+2 rows, 0 columns). Its shape is preserved.\n        *   In Example 3, the color 2 object translates 2 steps left (-2 rows, 0 columns). Its shape is preserved.\n        *   *Observation:* Objects of color 2 always seem to undergo a rigid translation (move without changing shape). The specific translation vector [(0,+2), (+2,0), (-2,0)] varies between examples.\n\n    *   **Color 5 Objects:**\n        *   In Example 1, the 2x2 block of color 5 at (6,4)-(7,5) transforms into a different shape (let's call it shape 'C') located roughly at (5,4)-(7,5). The top-left corner of the bounding box shifts by (-1 row, 0 columns).\n        *   In Example 2, the 2x2 block of color 5 at (6,4)-(7,5) transforms into another different shape (shape 'E') located roughly at (6,4)-(8,5). The top-left corner of the bounding box shifts by (0 rows, 0 columns).\n        *   In Example 3, the 2x2 block of color 5 at (6,4)-(7,5) transforms into shape 'C' again, located roughly at (5,3)-(7,5). The top-left corner of the bounding box shifts by (-1 row, -1 column).\n        *   *Observation:* Objects of color 5 (at least, the initial 2x2 block shape) undergo a transformation that involves both a shift and a change in shape. This transformation also varies between examples.\n\n4.  **Hypothesize Dependency:** Since the transformation applied to an object of a specific color is not constant across examples, it must depend on the context. Given that the color 5 object starts in the same configuration in all examples, the varying transformation applied to it likely depends on the properties (e.g., location, shape) of the color 2 object. Similarly, the varying translation applied to the color 2 object likely depends on its own properties or the properties of the color 5 object.\n\n5.  **Reasoning Process for Generating Output:**\n\n    *   Start with an output grid initialized with the background color (7).\n    *   Identify all distinct connected objects in the input grid that are not color 7.\n    *   For each identified object:\n        *   Determine its color.\n        *   Based on the observed patterns for that color and the context (likely the presence and nature of the *other* object in the grid), determine the appropriate transformation (translation for color 2, translation + shape change for color 5). The specific rules linking the context to the exact transformation parameters need to be inferred from the examples (e.g., if color 2 object is at position X, color 5 object transforms like *this*; if color 5 object is present, color 2 object at position Y translates like *that*).\n        *   Apply the determined transformation to the coordinates of the object's cells.\n        *   Place the object's color at the transformed coordinates in the output grid.\n\nThis process identifies objects, recognizes that transformations are color-dependent and context-dependent, and applies the specific transformation observed in the examples based on that context to generate the output.",

The order of arrangement (left to right) is determined by the *column index* of the digits in the input grid (ascending order).\n\n3.  **Generate Individual Patterns:**\n    *   For each isolated non-zero digit identified (in the order determined in step 2):\n        *   Create a new 3x3 grid, initially filled with zeros.\n        *   Use the \"shape template\" derived from the '1's cluster (step 1).\n        *   Place the value of the current isolated digit into the cells of the new 3x3 grid that correspond to the positions where '1's were present in the shape template.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Output Grid:**\n    *   Combine the individual 3x3 patterns generated in step 3 according to the structure (vertical stacking or horizontal arrangement) and order determined in step 2.\n    *   If stacking vertically, place the patterns one below the other.\n    *   If arranging horizontally, place the patterns side-by-side.\n\nThis process correctly transforms the input grid into the output grid by using the '1's as a shape template, the other non-zero digits as the \"colors\" for that template, and their relative positions in the input to determine the layout and order in the output.",

      "text": "Okay, let's analyze the examples to deduce the transformation logic.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Identify Common Elements:** In all examples, the input grids contain a predominant background color (7) and one or more connected shapes (components) made of other colors (6 in Ex1 & Ex2, 8 in Ex3). The output grids are mostly identical to the input, except some background cells (7) are changed to color 2.\n2.  **Focus on the Change:** The change involves turning some background cells (7) into color 2. These changed cells are always orthogonally adjacent (sharing an edge, not just a corner) to one of the non-background shapes.\n3.  **Identify the Trigger:** Not *all* background cells adjacent to *all* shapes change. There seems to be a selection process to determine *which* shape triggers the change.\n    *   In Example 1, there's a 'C' shape (10 cells of color 6) and an 'L' shape (9 cells of color 6). The 7s adjacent to the 'C' shape change to 2s, while those adjacent to the 'L' shape do not.\n    *   In Example 2, there's a '+' shape (5 cells of color 6) and a horizontal bar shape (3 cells of color 6). The 7s adjacent to the '+' shape change to 2s, while those adjacent to the bar shape do not.\n    *   In Example 3, there's an outer frame shape (28 cells of color 8) and an inner block shape (4 cells of color 8). The 7s adjacent to the *inner block* change to 2s, while those adjacent to the outer frame do not.\n4.  **Determine the Selection Criterion:** We need a rule that selects the 'C' in Ex1, the '+' in Ex2, and the inner block in Ex3.\n    *   Size doesn't work consistently (Largest in Ex1 & Ex2, Smallest in Ex3).\n    *   Let's count the number of adjacent background (7) cells for each component:\n        *   Ex1: 'C' has 6 adjacent 7s. 'L' has 13 adjacent 7s. ('C' selected - minimum count).\n        *   Ex2: '+' has 8 adjacent 7s. Bar has 8 adjacent 7s. ('+' selected - tie).\n        *   Ex3: Frame has 34 adjacent 7s. Block has 8 adjacent 7s. (Block selected - minimum count).\n    *   This suggests the rule selects the component with the *minimum* number of adjacent background cells.\n5.  **Handle Ties:** In Example 2, both components have 8 adjacent background cells. The '+' shape is selected. Its top-left cell is at (2,2). The bar's top-left cell is at (7,2). The rule likely uses a tie-breaker based on the position of the component's top-most, left-most cell (selecting the one that comes first in reading order).\n6.  **Final Rule Formulation:** The transformation identifies the connected component of non-background cells that has the fewest orthogonally adjacent background cells. If there's a tie, the component whose top-leftmost cell appears first is chosen. Then, all background cells adjacent to *this specific component* are changed to color 2.\n\n**Reasoning Process Explanation:**\n\nTo transform an input grid to an output grid, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Background:** Determine the background color, which is the most frequent color in the grid (color 7 in the examples).\n2.  **Find Components:** Identify all distinct connected components (groups) of cells that do *not* have the background color. Connectivity is defined by orthogonal adjacency (sharing an edge).\n3.  **Count Adjacent Background Cells:** For each non-background component identified, count how many background-colored cells are orthogonally adjacent to any cell within that component.\n4.  **Select Target Component:** Choose the component that has the *minimum* count of adjacent background cells.\n5.  **Resolve Ties:** If multiple components share the same minimum count, select the component whose top-most, left-most cell appears earliest in the grid when read row by row, then column by column.\n6.  **Apply Transformation:** Create the output grid by copying the input grid. Then, for every cell that has the background color *and* is orthogonally adjacent to the selected target component (from steps 4 & 5), change its color to 2. All other cells retain their original color from the input grid.",

When a 1 changes, it always changes into the target color T identified for that specific example.\n\n4.  **Determining the Condition for Change:** The core task is to figure out *which* 1s change to T.\n    *   The change seems localized within each 3x3 subgrid.\n    *   Comparing the examples, the *pattern* of which 1s change within a 3x3 subgrid is different depending on the target color T.\n    *   Let's map the relative coordinates (row, col) within a 3x3 subgrid (ranging from (0,0) to (2,2)) where a '1' changes to T:\n        *   **Example 1 (T=6):** Changes occur if a '1' is at relative coordinates (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), or (2,1).\n        *   **Example 2 (T=8):** Changes occur if a '1' is at relative coordinates (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), or (1,2).\n        *   **Example 3 (T=3):** Changes occur if a '1' is at relative coordinates (0,0), (1,1), or (2,2) (i.e., the main diagonal).\n\n5.  **Formulating the Reasoning Process:**\n\n    1.  **Identify the Target Color (T):** Scan the input grid to find the unique color that is not 0, 1, or 4. This is T (e.g., 6, 8, or 3 in the examples).\n    2.  **Determine the Transformation Pattern:** Based on the value of T, select the corresponding set of relative 3x3 coordinates where transformations occur:\n        *   If T = 3, the set is {(0,0), (1,1), (2,2)}.\n        *   If T = 6, the set is {(0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1)}.\n        *   If T = 8, the set is {(0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)}.\n    3.  **Apply the Transformation:**\n        *   Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n        *   Iterate through the input grid, identifying the top-left corner of each 3x3 subgrid (these are the cells not adjacent to a 4, or at the grid edge).\n        *   For each cell within a 3x3 subgrid:\n            *   Determine its relative coordinates (row, col) within that subgrid (from 0 to 2).\n            *   Check if the input cell value is 1.\n            *   Check if its relative coordinates (row, col) are present in the set determined in step 2.\n            *   If *both* conditions are true, change the corresponding cell value in the output grid to T.\n        *   Cells that were originally 0, 4, or T, or cells that were 1 but whose relative coordinates were *not* in the target set, remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\nThis process correctly transforms the input to the output for all provided examples by identifying a target color and applying a position-based rule within subgrids, where the rule itself depends on the target color.",

The grid is divided into blocks separated by rows and columns of 4s, which remain unchanged in the transformation.\n\n2.

The replacement follows these rules:\n   - For horizontal pairs of 1s (two 1s side by side), the leftmost 1 is replaced with the special value.\n   - For vertical pairs of 1s (two 1s stacked), the top 1 is replaced with the special value.\n   - For diagonal pairs of 1s, the 1 in the upper-left or upper-right position is replaced with the special value.\n\n4. All other values in the grid (0s and 4s) remain unchanged.\n\n## Application Process\n\nTo transform an input grid to an output grid:\n\n1. Preserve all 4s as they are (they serve as block separators).\n2. Identify the special value being used in the current example (6, 8, or 3).\n3. Scan each block (area between the 4s) for adjacent 1s:\n   - For horizontal pairs (1,1), replace the left 1 with the special value\n   - For vertical pairs, replace the top 1 with the special value\n   - For diagonal pairs, replace the upper 1 with the special value\n4. Keep all other values (0s and non-paired 1s) unchanged.\n\nThis transformation essentially highlights certain patterns of 1s in the grid by marking one of the 1s in each pair with a special value, creating a visual indication of where these patterns occur.",

Separate adjacent output cells with a single column of the digit '8'.

      "text": "Okay, here's the reasoning process based on the provided examples:\n\n1.  **Observe Input/Output Structure:** The input is a 3x9 grid containing 0s and 5s. The output is also a 3x9 grid, but notably, all three rows in the output grid are identical.\n\n2.  **Identify Segmentation:** The 9 columns seem to be processed in groups of three. The input grid can be viewed as three consecutive 3x3 subgrids.\n    *   Columns 0, 1, 2 form the first 3x3 subgrid.\n    *   Columns 3, 4, 5 form the second 3x3 subgrid.\n    *   Columns 6, 7, 8 form the third 3x3 subgrid.\n\n3.  **Analyze Subgrid Transformation:** Each 3x3 input subgrid corresponds to a single output value, which then populates the corresponding three columns in the output grid (across all rows).\n\n4.  **Determine the Mapping Rule:** The specific pattern formed by the '5' values within each 3x3 input subgrid determines the output value for that segment. Let's map the patterns seen in the examples:\n    *   **Input Subgrid Pattern (5s)** | **Output Value**\n    *   -----------------------------|-----------------\n    *   `[[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]` (Top row) | `6` (Example 1, Subgrid 1; Example 3, Subgrid 2)\n    *   `[[5, 5, 5], [5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 5]]` (Frame/Border) | `3` (Example 1, Subgrid 2; Example 3, Subgrid 3; Example 4, Subgrid 1)\n    *   `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5]]` (Bottom row) | `1` (Example 1, Subgrid 3; Example 2, Subgrid 2)\n    *   `[[0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0]]` (Anti-diagonal) | `9` (Example 2, Subgrid 1; Example 4, Subgrid 3)\n    *   `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0]]` (Center only) | `4` (Example 2, Subgrid 3; Example 3, Subgrid 1; Example 4, Subgrid 2)\n    *   `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]` (All zeros - not explicitly shown, but implied if no 5s) | Likely `4` based on Example 2/4 Col 6/8, but needs confirmation. *Correction*: Example 2 Col 6/8 and Example 4 Col 8 show `[0,0,0]` columns mapping to `4`, suggesting the `[0,0,0],[0,5,0],[0,0,0]` subgrid pattern maps to 4.\n\n5.  **Construct the Output:**\n    *   Take the input 3x9 grid.\n    *   Examine the first 3x3 subgrid (columns 0-2). Identify the pattern of 5s. Find the corresponding output value using the mapping rule derived above.\n    *   Fill columns 0, 1, and 2 of *all three rows* in the output grid with this value.\n    *   Repeat this process for the second 3x3 subgrid (columns 3-5), filling columns 3, 4, and 5 of the output grid with its corresponding value.\n    *   Repeat for the third 3x3 subgrid (columns 6-8), filling columns 6, 7, and 8 of the output grid.\n\n**In summary:** The transformation involves dividing the 3x9 input grid into three 3x3 subgrids. Each subgrid's pattern of '5's maps to a specific digit. This digit is then replicated across all three rows for the corresponding three columns in the output grid.",

These act as a frame or fixed reference.\n\n2.  **Identify Dynamic Elements (Clusters):** Focus on the connected groups (clusters) of numbers that are *not* the background color (7) and *not* in the leftmost column (8s). In the input grids, these clusters (e.g., 9s, 3s, 1s in Ex 1; 9s, 2s in Ex 2; 2s, 4s, 3s, 6s in Ex 3) are located on the right side of the grid.\n\n3.  **Analyze Spatial Transformation:**\n    *   The clusters identified on the right side of the input grid are moved to the left side of the output grid (specifically, occupying the columns immediately to the right of the fixed leftmost column).\n    *   The *shape* of each cluster is preserved during this move.\n    *   The *relative vertical order* of the clusters is also preserved.

Let this be `InputColors = [C_in_0, C_in_1, ..., C_in_N-1]`.\n    *   **Apply N-Dependent Color Rule:** The color assigned to the i-th cluster (from the top) in the *output* (`C_out_i`) depends on N and the `InputColors`:\n        *   **If N = 2 (Example 2):** The colors do not change. `C_out_i = C_in_i`.

The fourth cluster takes the color of the original second cluster. `C_out = [C_in_0, C_in_2, C_in_3, C_in_1]`.

Note the number (color) in each of these cells.\n\n3.  **Determine Movement Rule Based on Boundaries:**\n    *   Check if the number (color) of an isolated non-zero cell matches the number (color) of *any* of the identified boundary lines.\n    *   **If it matches:** The cell will move.\n        *   If the boundaries are *horizontal* lines, the cell moves *vertically* (up or down).\n        *   If the boundaries are *vertical* lines, the cell moves *horizontally* (left or right).\n        *   The cell moves towards the *nearest* boundary line (in the allowed direction). If there's no boundary line in one direction, the grid edge acts as the limit.\n        *   The cell stops in the position immediately *adjacent* to the boundary line it moved towards (or at the grid edge if no boundary was encountered).\n    *   **If it does not match:** The cell is removed (its position becomes 0 in the output grid).\n\n4.  **Construct the Output Grid:**\n    *   Start with an empty grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with zeros.\n    *   Copy the identified boundary lines from the input grid directly to the output grid in their original positions.\n    *   For each isolated non-zero cell identified in step 2:\n        *   If it was determined to move (because its number matched a boundary number), place its number in its calculated final position (adjacent to the nearest boundary).\n        *   If it was determined to be removed (number didn't match), do nothing (its original spot remains 0, and it doesn't appear elsewhere).\n    *   All cells that were originally 0 in the input remain 0 in the output, unless a moving object lands on them.\n\n**In essence:** Boundary lines (horizontal or vertical) remain fixed. Other non-zero cells only \"survive\" and move if their number matches one of the boundary line numbers. They then travel perpendicularly towards the nearest boundary line and stop right next to it.

If we extract the content *strictly inside* this frame (i.e., rows 12-19 and columns 12-21), we get an 8x10 grid which exactly matches the output grid.\n\n2.  **Example 2:** The input grid is 19x13, and the output is 6x7.

Note the specific digit used for the frame (e.g., 4, 8, or 1 in the examples).\n2.  **Determine Frame Boundaries:** Find the coordinates defining this rectangular frame: the top-most row (`min_row`), bottom-most row (`max_row`), left-most column (`min_col`), and right-most column (`max_col`).\n3.  **Extract Inner Content:** The output grid is the subgrid contained *strictly inside* the identified frame. This means the output grid consists of the cells from the input grid starting at row `min_row + 1` and ending at row `max_row - 1`, and starting at column `min_col + 1` and ending at column `max_col - 1`.\n4.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid using the extracted cells, maintaining their relative positions.",

Any remaining slots in that block (if the output grid is wider due to other input glyphs having multiple payloads) are filled with the default glyph (Shape '1', colored with '1' and the `Structure Color`).\n        *   The `Structure Color` from the input is used as the separator color between glyphs in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Applying to Examples:**\n    *   **Example 1:** Structure color=2. Input is 3x2 glyphs. Max payloads per glyph=2 (the '3' shape has payloads 3 and 1). Output grid is 3 rows, 2 columns of glyphs.\n        *   Input TL ('3' shape, payloads 3, 1) -> Output TL=Shape '3'(color 3, sec 2), Output TR=Shape '1'(color 1, sec 2).\n        *   Input ML ('4' shape, payload 4) -> Output ML=Shape '4'(color 4, sec 2). The MR slot gets the default: Output MR=Shape '1'(color 1, sec 2).\n        *   Input BL ('3' shape, payloads 3, 1) -> Output BL=Shape '3'(color 3, sec 2), Output BR=Shape '1'(color 1, sec 2).\n        *   The other input glyphs ('1' shapes) have no payload, yielding default Shape '1'(1,2), which fills slots already assigned by the multi-payload rule or the default fill rule.\n    *   **Example 2:** Structure color=1. Input is 2x1 glyphs. Max payloads per glyph=2 (the '2' shape has payloads 2, 8). Output grid is 2 rows, 2 columns of glyphs.\n        *   Input Top ('2' shape, payloads 2, 8) -> Output TL=Shape '2'(color 2, sec 1), Output TR=Shape '8'(color 8, sec 1).\n        *   Input Bottom ('4' shape, payload 4) -> Output BL=Shape '4'(color 4, sec 1). The BR slot gets the default: Output BR=Shape '1'(color 1, sec 1).\n\nThis reasoning process consistently explains how the input grids are transformed into the output grids in both examples.",

The background is represented by the color 0.\n\n2.  **Determine Target Vertical Position:** Calculate the average row index of *all* non-zero cells across all identified shapes in the input grid.

It stops when it hits the grid boundary or another *original* non-zero cell from the input cluster.\n\n5.  **Diagonal Propagation (Non-Center Row Rule):**\n    *   Look at the cells with non-zero values `v` at `(r, c)` that are *not* in the center row(s) of the original cluster.\n    *   Determine if the cell's column `c` is to the left, right, or in the center column(s) identified in step 3.\n    *   If column `c` is *left* of the center column(s): Propagate the value `v` diagonally outwards in both the up-left (`row--`, `col--`) and down-left (`row++`, `col--`) directions.\n    *   If column `c` is *right* of the center column(s): Propagate the value `v` diagonally outwards in both the up-right (`row--`, `col++`) and down-right (`row++`, `col++`) directions.\n    *   If column `c` is *in* the center column(s): Do *not* perform diagonal propagation for this cell's value.\n    *   This diagonal propagation fills only zero cells and stops when it hits any grid boundary.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe transformation involves copying the original pattern, then extending specific values based on their position relative to the cluster's center. Values in the center row propagate horizontally, while values in non-center rows propagate diagonally, with the diagonal direction (left vs. right) determined by whether the value's column is left or right of the center column. Values in the center column *and* a non-center row do not propagate diagonally.",

      "text": "# Pattern Analysis: Grid Transformation Logic\n\nAfter analyzing the examples, I can see that the transformation follows a pattern where certain cells in the input grid are shifted in a zigzag or alternating pattern in the output grid. Here's the specific reasoning:\n\n## The Transformation Rule\n\n1. **Preserve the overall shape**: The basic structure (like rectangles or frames) is maintained.\n\n2. **Alternating shift pattern**: \n   - For rows with even index positions (0-indexed, so rows 0, 2, 4, etc.), cells are shifted one position to the left.\n   - For rows with odd index positions (rows 1, 3, 5, etc.), cells are shifted one position to the right.\n\n3. **Border preservation**: The outer border or frame of the shape remains in the same position, while the internal elements follow the zigzag shift pattern.\n\n4. **Empty space handling**: When a shift would move a non-zero value outside the original shape's boundary, that value appears to wrap to the opposite side of the same row, maintaining the overall structure.\n\n## Application Process\n\nTo transform an input grid to an output grid:\n1. Identify the shape formed by non-zero values\n2. For each row:\n   - If it's an even-indexed row: shift non-zero values one position left\n   - If it's an odd-indexed row: shift non-zero values one position right\n3. Maintain the overall frame/boundary of the shape\n4. Ensure any shifted elements that would exit the shape's boundary wrap around to the opposite side of the same row\n\nThis creates the zigzag or alternating pattern visible in all examples, where the shape appears to \"wave\" or \"undulate\" while maintaining its overall structure and boundaries.",

When a cell in the input grid has a value of 5, it gets transformed in the output grid:\n   - If the 5 is in the top-right half of the grid (above or on the main diagonal from top-left to bottom-right), it becomes 8\n   - If the 5 is in the bottom-left half of the grid (below the main diagonal), it becomes 2\n\n2. All other cells (with value 7) remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\nThe main diagonal runs from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (15,15) of the 16\u00d716 grid. This diagonal serves as the dividing line for determining whether a 5 transforms into an 8 or a 2.\n\nTo apply this transformation rule:\n1. For each cell position (i,j) in the grid:\n   - If the value is 5, check its position relative to the diagonal\n     - If i \u2264 j (on or above diagonal): change to 8\n     - If i > j (below diagonal): change to 2\n   - If the value is not 5: keep it unchanged\n\nThis rule correctly explains all the transformations observed in both example grids.",
